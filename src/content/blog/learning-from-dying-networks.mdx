The back half of 2024 was rough for smaller companies with impressive global networks. 

*   In June, [StackPath closed its doors](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/stackpath-to-close-down-liquidate-assets/) after raising some $400M and deploying an edge compute platform to at least 45 PoPs. The company had already dismantled its Highwinds / MaxCDN / NetDNA roll up CDN in 2023, selling the larger accounts to Akamai.

*   In September, just a year after Limelight and Edgecast became Edgio (EGIOQ), the company announced it had entered bankruptcy. Eight weeks later, [Akamai nabbed](https://www.streamingmediablog.com/2024/11/akamai-acquires-edgio-contracts.html) the delivery customers for $125M. As for its 300 global PoPs, the status is unclear.

*   In November, Equinix announced that it would [shutter Equinix Metal](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/equinix-to-kill-off-metal-by-june-2026/) and its freshly deployed 40+ location bare metal footprint and IP network.

*   If you turn back the clock a few more years the graveyard includes names like Lumen CDN (CenturyLink), Instart Logic (also taken over by Akamai), Subspace, Edge Gravity, and Internap. [Dan Rayburn's list](http://www.streamingmediablog.com/2023/01/cdn-list.html) is pretty exhaustive.

While there are still a number of niche players who have built their own networks (shout out to pure play delivery folks like KeyCDN, CDN77, and CacheFly; network-focused hosting companies like NetActuate, EdgeUno, and Latitude; and 2nd tier clouds Digital Ocean, Servers.com, Vultr, and OVH), the question must be asked: what gives?

## The Paradox of Scale

Most recent failures (StackPath, Edgio, etc) simply didn't generate enough market traction to overcome the weight of expensive infrastructure footprints. Aside from Equinix Metal, which never offered a delivery product, most edge platforms started with a CDN as the "no brainer" way to monetize the distributed network they were building.  

Unfortunately, core CDN products have a 20 year history of commoditization, framed against a backdrop of rising underlying costs. As Matt Levine, one of the smartest folks in the business, [recently wrote](https://www.cachefly.com/news/cdn-pricing-trends-in-2024-why-the-era-of-falling-costs-is-ending/):

_As bandwidth costs bottom out, other operational expenses are becoming more prominent. Power, labor, cross-connects, and compute resources are now the dominant factors in CDN pricing, and these costs are experiencing steady inflationary pressures._

Unlike traditional SaaS or other industries, if you're delivering bits for money, the attack vectors and scale of the internet simply require you to get big quickly in order to even offer a basic service. And while you don't need thousands of POPs to be relevant, you do need 15-30 key global locations with substantial routing, server, transit, peering and direct connectivity capacity. That's a lot of CAPEX, but also ongoing OPEX and inherent upgrade cycles.

## Survival of the (Product Market) Fittest

Outside of the hyperscale networks, the most recognized global edge networks are Cloudflare, Akamai, and Fastly. Each has moved heavily into security over the last few years and built up a platform story. Here is some copy I took from their respective websites:

1.  **Cloudflare is the Connectivity Cloud** - Cloudflare is built on an intelligent, secure, high-speed global network. We help businesses regain control of their technology and security environments by reducing complexity and improving visibility across their on-premises, public cloud, SaaS and public Internet domains.

2.  **Akamai is the Connected Cloud** - Akamai Connected Cloud brings core cloud computing and edge computing together, along with industry-leading security and content delivery — all on the most distributed platform on the planet.

3.  **Fastly is a Platform with a Difference** \- Fastly's best-in-class edge cloud platform helps you modernize and automate more to meet your biggest challenges head-on. Take your first step toward better margins, higher developer productivity, faster innovation cycles, and new levels of reliability.

These are each amazing global platforms with hundreds of TB's of connected capacity. But the story in the market suggests that all is not equal — Fastly is trading at 1.9x revenue, Akamai at 3.63x, and Cloudflare at 22.5x. One of these is not like the other! While Akamai is a more mature business, it's clear that growth is what drives stock value:

*   Akamai (AKAM) reported $1 billion in revenue for the quarter ended September 2024, representing a year-over-year increase of 4.1% (less than inflation). They had a $14B market cap.
*   Cloudflare (NET) reported $430.1 million in revenue for the quarter ended September 2024, representing a year-over-year increase of 28%. They had a $34B market cap.

It's clear that Cloudflare's platform experience, hybrid sales motion, and rapidly expanding product portfolio has created a compelling engine that customers want. 

## The 'Deploy Everywhere" Cohort

Because of the underlying economics and competitive market dynamics, new cloud companies haven't even tried to build their own networks.

There are a growing number of platforms that help developers (or even non-developers like me) deploy and manage apps at scale without worrying about infrastructure, let alone networks. These are modern versions of the grand daddy of "PaaS" ( ♥️Heroku ♥️) and they're creating an entire generation of folks whose default deployment target is "everywhere" vs "US-EAST". 

Vercel is probably the biggest of the lot, having raised $250M in fresh capital to expand its AI and security features, which includes a [WAF](https://vercel.com/docs/security/vercel-waf) and a firewall service alongside reduced [bandwidth pricing](https://vercel.com/blog/improved-infrastructure-pricing) (down from a shocking $0.40/GB to a still incredible $0.15/GB).

The difference here is that Vercel doesn't own any infrastructure. It's built on top of AWS! And for customers, the value is abstraction, automation, and platform features — not cheaper bandwidth or differentiated network access, routes or performance. 

If you're not competing on moving bits, do you really need to own your network, or can you just borrow one? It seems the answer for this class of startups is to borrow! Of all my favorite platforms, only Fly.io runs a good chunk of its own infrastructure. Go, Kurt, go!

What this tells me — aside from the fact that AWS and GCP are fantastic businesses — is that software has largely caught up to the "run anywhere" promise of cloud native, and that even the most infrastructure-focused developers don't think below Layer 4.

With public clouds, smart teams like these can leverage common tooling (Kubernetes or other advanced schedulers like Nomad, distributed databases, standard observability stacks, service meshes, etc) to build and run their own global clouds. They may not have a great cost basis or full control under the hood, but they don't have to build a massive global footprint to deliver value to clients. As [GEICO](https://www.thestack.technology/warren-buffetts-geico-repatriates-work-from-the-cloud-continues-ambitious-infrastructure-overhaul/) and [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/cloud-exit) recently demonstrated, one can certainly buy gear further down the road when the numbers make sense.

Time will tell if this class of companies — which are directing capital towards platform features and customer acquisition instead of their own infrastructure — fares better than the network builders of the previous wave.

## The Private Interconnection Club

Although it's harder to see, there is an entire ecosystem of providers working on the private side of the internet: Equinix Fabric, Digital Realty Service Fabric, PCCW Console Connect, Packet Fabric (for now!), and Megaport. Traditional telcos like Lumen and Zayo are also playing a bit above transit and transport by packaging up their IP offerings.

These folks operate in network OSI layers 0 through 3 and offer physical cables (cross connects) or virtual cables (VLANS-as-a-service). Many now provide Layer 3 services via cloud routers, but their bread and butter is private interconnection and routing traffic between diverse networks. 

This lower layer is profitable, but with a catch: you need to either have "owner economics" on the underlying telco or ensure that interconnection happens exclusively in buildings that you operate. 

While these services continue to grow, the experience caters to a network/I.T. buyer that is aging out, or at least becoming more niche. It's unlikely that any of the "deploy everywhere" platforms even know about these services, which aren't designed for them. Instead, they were designed for folks who build, deploy and manage _physical_ infrastructure and networks.  

In the next decade, one might ask "if a cross connect fails, and a developer isn't there to notice, did it really fail?"

## The Emerging AI Landscape

It's obvious that the artificial intelligence craze stimulated by ChatGPT and broader generative AI has kicked off a huge infrastructure buildout. 

While much of the focus has been on GPU capacity and the associated space/power/cooling to support those servers, it's clearly driving network demand as well. Telco provider Lumen saw its fortunes reverse after years of eroding margins and a stagnant stock price. Announcing [$5B in new orders](https://ir.lumen.com/news/news-details/2024/AI-Demand-Drives-5-Billion-in-New-Business-and-Massive-Expansion-of-the-Internet/default.aspx) driven by AI companies seems to have a positive impact!

In terms of AI specific clouds, CoreWeave is the furthest ahead in [building their own network](https://www.peeringdb.com/net/33996), showing up at all the expected Equinix peering locations in the United States as well as some other interconnection points.  

On the other hand, [Lambda](https://www.peeringdb.com/net/33996) and [Crusoe](https://www.peeringdb.com/net/37006) both have limited footprints. [Ori, an AI company](https://www.ori.co/) that offers both public and private clouds, leverages a new purpose-built connectivity platform called [Stelia](https://www.peeringdb.com/net/25494). We expect that the data and network heavy nature of AI workloads will encourage more examples like this to pop up. 

In the meantime, Cloudflare is busy deploying GPUs to support its serverless Workers AI product, with [more than 150](https://www.ciodive.com/news/cloudflare-hugging-face-generative-ai-edge-infrastructure/712036/) locations live so far.

## 7 Lessons Learned

It's always been madness to build and run a global network...until it isn't (looking at you Netflix, Apple, Roblox, VISA, Walmart, Meta, etc). In order to succeed, we're taking some lessons from the recent failures and successes.  

*   **Rule #1: Don't Overbuild** \- If you're going to build a network, you can't overburden the business with costs until there is a durable product-market fit. Be scrappy, borrow what you can, and build what you need.

*   **Rule #2: Embrace Federation** - There is a lot of value in owning big iron, but why restrict value to just your own pipes? We're taking a page from the "deploy everywhere" folks and helping to make the experience of using other infrastructure providers better.

*   **Rule #3: The Customer is Software** \- A fast, global, programmatic experience with a full suite of creature comforts is non-negotiable. To compete on the "fastest" pipes or computers alone truly is madness.**‍**
*   **Rule #4: Neutrality is a Superpower** - Companies are complex and interact with more ecosystems and customers every day. To create a durable network effect, it's important to invite a lot of friends to the party.
*   ‍**Rule #5: Don't Margin Stack Thy Partner** - Commercial models are difficult, but having a rebill or marketplace solution helps everyone understand the unique value you provide, and where you're simply facilitating an experience. **‍**
*   **Rule #6: Connect Ecosystems, Don't Replace Them** - The world is getting more complex, not less. We're building a network cloud that thrives when folks use more AWS, Cloudflare, or Equinix alongside Snowflake, MongoDB, or Databricks.**‍**
*   **Rule #7: Outcomes, Not Jargon** - Networking superpowers don't need to be wrapped in a foreign language. In other words, let's spend our energy on routing not routers, and connections not connectivity.

We believe that the gap between network "have" and "have nots" is growing alongside a Cambrian explosion in complexity driven by AI, distributed systems, public cloud, wireless, and localized regulation. 

Our mission is to level the playing field in a way that application and DevOps teams love. More "Plaid for Networks" than "A-Side" to "Z-Side".

Wish us luck!
