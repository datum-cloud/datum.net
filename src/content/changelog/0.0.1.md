We’ve introduced a self-service telemetry dashboard for real-time visibility into HTTP Proxy instances. Monitor performance, understand traffic patterns, and troubleshoot services across deployed edge locations.

Highlights:
- Self-Service Monitoring – View proxy metrics without needing support intervention.
- Real-Time Visibility – Live metrics with automatic refresh for immediate service health awareness.
- Traffic Insights – Understand traffic patterns, geographic distribution, and performance details.
- Troubleshooting Support – Diagnose and resolve proxy-related issues with actionable data.
- Performance Transparency – Track key metrics including request rates, response times, error rates, and connection health.
