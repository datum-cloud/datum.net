We’ve enhanced the Account Settings page to offer more control.

Highlights:
- Profile Updates – Change first and last name.
- Account Identities – View linked accounts (e.g., Google Workspace, GitHub).
- Timezone Control – Set preferred timezone.
- Portal Preferences – Adjust settings like theme.
- Email Subscriptions – Opt in or out of newsletters.
- Account Deletion – Permanently delete an account when needed.
