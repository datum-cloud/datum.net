We’ve introduced a new signup and login UI, built with ZITADEL’s TypeScript SDK.

Highlights:
- Branded – Implemented a theme for Datum Cloud, replacing Zitadel defaults.
- Auth – End-to-end flows for login, logout, token refresh, and session restoration.
- User State Handling – Enhanced support for managing authenticated user sessions.
