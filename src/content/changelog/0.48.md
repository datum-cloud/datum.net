## New Tab model and improved completions

### New Tab model

We've trained a new Tab model that now can suggest changes across multiple files. The model excels particularly at refactors, edit chains, multi file changes, and jumping between related code. You'll also notice it feels more natural and snappier in day-to-day use.

With this we've also added syntax highlighting to the completion suggestions.

### Improved completions

* Enhanced syntax highlighting for all supported languages
* Better context awareness for multi-file suggestions
* Improved accuracy for refactoring suggestions
* Faster response times for completion requests
* Better handling of complex code structures
* Enhanced support for modern JavaScript/TypeScript features
* Improved completion quality for Python and Go
* Better handling of imports and dependencies

### Performance improvements

* Reduced latency for completion requests
* Optimized memory usage for large codebases
* Improved caching for frequently used completions
* Better handling of concurrent requests
* Enhanced background processing for suggestions

### Bug fixes

* Fixed issues with completion suggestions in large files
* Resolved problems with multi-file refactoring
* Fixed syntax highlighting in certain edge cases
* Improved handling of special characters in completions
* Fixed issues with completion timing in certain scenarios
