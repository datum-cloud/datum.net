# Version 0.49

## Rules generation, improved agent terminal and MCP images

### Automated and improved rules

You can now generate rules directly from a conversation using the `/Generate Cursor Rules` command. This is useful when you want to capture the existing context of a conversation to reuse later.

For `Auto Attached` rules with path patterns defined, Agent will now automatically apply the right rules when reading or writing files.

We've also fixed a long-standing issue where `Always` attached rules now persist across longer conversations. Agent can now also edit rules reliably.

### More accessible history

Chat history has moved into the command palette. You can access it from the "Show history button" in Chat as well as through the `Show Chat History` command.

### Making reviews easier

Reviewing agent generated code is now easier with a built-in diff view at the end of each conversation. You'll find the `Review changes` button at the bottom of chat after a message from the agent.

### Improvements
