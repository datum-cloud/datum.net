The Datum Cloud platform uses short-lived Bearer tokens for API authentication.
These tokens are managed automatically by the `datumctl` CLI, which handles login,
credential storage, and token refresh.

## Log In
Authenticate with Datum Cloud:

```shell
▶ datumctl auth login
```
This command will open your default browser, prompt to log you in, and store your credentials in the system’s keyring.
Note: If your browser doesn't open automatically, the command will display a URL that you can copy and paste into your browser manually.

## List Your Organizations
Once authenticated, view the organizations you have access to:

```shell
▶ datumctl get organizations
```
## Configure Kubernetes Access 
To use kubectl with your Datum Cloud resources:
```shell
▶ # Using an organization ID
datumctl auth update-kubeconfig --organization <org-id>

# Or using a project ID
datumctl auth update-kubeconfig --project <project-id>
```
Now you can use standard kubectl commands to interact with your Datum Cloud control plane.
