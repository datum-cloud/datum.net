Datum Cloud provides a declarative API platform to create the infrastructure
necessary to deploy and manage services with advanced networking capabilities.
Many of our APIs are exposed through a Kubernetes API as [Custom Resources]
enabling you to use much of the tooling available within the Kubernetes
ecosystem to interact with our API.

[Custom Resources]:
