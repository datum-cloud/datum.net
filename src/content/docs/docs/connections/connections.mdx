Much like any backbone, Galactic VPC’s virtual backbone capability will need a place to meet with more networks. In the traditional datacenter and physical network world, this would commonly be a shared “meet me room” or managed interconnection service from a colocation provider, that allows you to request connections to or accept connections from other networks.

With Galactic, Datum is providing a virtual meet me room equivalent that will start with overlay connections (VPN’s, SD-WAN, Tailscale, etc) and later support physical connections, network-as-a-service providers (Equinix Fabric, Megaport, etc) and cloud provider connectivity (AWS Direct Connect, Azure Express Route, etc).

The first connection we are working to enable is Datum Tunnel built on Iroh, a QUIC-based protocol with peer-2-peer capabilities and robust, certificate based routing.  Datum Tunnel will allow for a reverse-tunnel connection to be created from a desktop or server/container environment and connect to Datum’s proxy service.  Later, this will be managed with integration to Galactic VPC as the service becomes production ready.
