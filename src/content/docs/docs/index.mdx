---

We’re creating Datum to be the world’s first truly open network cloud — a neutral place where AI native builders, modern “alt cloud” providers, tech incumbents, and digital leaders can programmatically connect with their unique ecosystems.

In plain English, Datum Cloud helps you interact with the global internet, protect your applications, manage common infrastructure-related assets (like domains and DNS), orchestrate operational workflows, and securely connect with apps, endpoints, and partners. As you might expect, everything at Datum is 100% programmatic.

Here are some features we’d tell you about over a cup of coffee if we had the chance:
- We focus on Kubernetes (datumctl) and AI-native (Datum MCP) interfaces
- We provide an OTel-compatible metrics export to Grafana Cloud and others
- We don’t charge for “enterprise” features like RBAC, audit logs, etc.
- We run a powerful global Anycast network so you don’t have to
- We also support a “bring your own” model to take our cloud where it needs to go
- Our code is backed by permissive AGPLv3 open source licenses

We currently offer a forever free “Builder” tier alongside a planned “Scaler” tier for self-service production workloads and backbone connections. Our “Provider” tier is a unique, high-touch offering that combines decades of human expertise with our platform capabilities to help [Alt Clouds providers](https://github.com/datum-cloud/awesome-alt-clouds) scale better and grow faster.

Founded in 2024 and launched in 2025, Datum is based in New York City and backed by a diverse group of investors. You can learn more [about us here](https://www.datum.net/about).
