ExportPolicies allow users to export telemetry data to the telemetry provider of their choice. Here use Grafana Cloud as a target for data export. We provide a nice user experience for users wanting to export telemetry data to Grafana Cloud.
This tutorial shows you how to export metrics from your Datum project to Grafana Cloud using an ExportPolicy and Secret.

## Before you begin

This tutorial assumes you have already:

- [Registered a Datum account](/docs/quickstart/account-setup/)
- [Created a Datum project](/docs/platform/projects/)
- A Grafana Cloud account with an active instance

## Overview

You will configure metric export by:

1. Accessing your Grafana Cloud instance
2. Generating Prometheus remote write configuration
3. Creating Datum Secret and ExportPolicy resources

The process extracts connection details from Grafana Cloud's generated
configuration and creates the necessary Datum resources automatically.

## Step 1: Setup your Grafana Cloud export
1. From the left-hand navigation in cloud.datum.net, choose Metrics
2. Click **+ Create an export policy**
3. For Export to Grafana Cloud, click **Create the Export Policy**
4. Enter your Grafana instance URL and select **Continue**
5. Get your Promethius remote_write YAML from Grafana by selecting  the **Open link** button . 
6. Complete the Grafana Hosted Prometheus metrics form, then copy the prometheus.yaml file using the **copy to clipboard** button.   
The prometheus.yaml looks similar to this:

```yaml
remote_write:
  - url: https://prometheus-prod-56-prod-us-east-2.grafana.net/api/prom/push
    basic_auth:
      username: 123456
      password: glc_eyJvIjoiNzA2...
```
7. Return to the export policy configuration in the Datum portal and paste the yaml into the remote_write field before submitting

## Step 2: View metrics in Grafana Cloud

1. Return to your Grafana Cloud instance
2. Navigate to **Explore** in the left sidebar
3. Select your Prometheus data source
4. Run a query like `{service_name="telemetry.miloapis.com"}` to see your metrics

## Step 3: Datum Dashboards in Grafana Cloud
To add prebuilt Datum dashboards in Grafana Cloud, go to **Dashboards**, select **New dashboard**, then choose **Import dashboard**.
The Datum dashboards can be loaded using the following Grafana IDs.
### Datum Overview
Grafana ID: **23939**

Provides real-time visibility into Datum Proxy infrastructure, including:
- Total HTTP proxies, hostnames, and domains
- Upstream requests per second (RPS) by region
- Global response codes and latency percentiles
- Domain and proxy health status
### Datum Proxy
Grafana ID: **24261**

Offers a real-time view of HTTP proxy hostnames and regional upstream traffic, including:
- Regional RPS and upstream response codes
- Latency percentiles (p90, p99)
- Domain and proxy status
