Datum collects OpenTelemetry metrics from your Datum infrastructure and services, providing visibility into the performance and health of your workloads.

## Exporting Metrics

Currently, Datum supports exporting metrics to **Grafana Cloud**. Custom export policies for other observability platforms are coming soon.

ExportPolicies allow you to configure how metrics are exported from the Datum platform to Grafana Cloud. Each ExportPolicy defines:

- **Sources**: Select metrics using MetricSQL queries to filter which telemetry data to export
- **Sinks**: Configure destination endpoints where metrics should be sent (Prometheus remote write endpoints for Grafana Cloud)

## Getting Started

See our [Export to Grafana Cloud](/docs/metrics/grafana-cloud/) guide for a step-by-step tutorial on setting up metric export to Grafana Cloud. The guide walks you through:

1. Accessing your Grafana Cloud instance
2. Generating Prometheus remote write configuration
3. Creating the necessary Datum Secret and ExportPolicy resources
4. Verifying your metrics are being exported successfully
