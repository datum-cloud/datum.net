Datum is the world’s first truly open network cloud — built by industry veterans to be a neutral place where AI native builders, alternative cloud providers, tech incumbents, and digital leaders can programmatically connect with their unique ecosystems.

In plain English, Datum Cloud helps you interact with the global internet, protect your applications, manage common infrastructure-related assets (like domains and DNS), orchestrate operational workflows, and securely connect with apps, endpoints, and partners. As you might expect, everything at Datum is 100% programmatic.

Here are some features we’d tell you about over a cup of coffee if we had the chance:
- We focus on Kubernetes (datumctl) and AI-native (Datum MCP) interfaces
- We provide an OTel-compatible metrics export to Grafana Cloud and others
- We don’t charge for “enterprise” features like SSO, RBAC, audit logs, etc.
- We run a global anycast network in 25+ locations
Our code is backed by permissive AGPLv3 open source licenses

We currently offer a free “Builder” tier alongside an “Alt Cloud” tier that includes dedicated namespaces, your own custom ASN, managed private networks, BYOC data planes, and common sense tooling for scaling cloud services.

We are currently focused on building out “house brand” services and nailing a great developer experience, but hope and expect to expose partner technologies on our platform soon.

We plan to make money by moving traffic, creating connections between parties, and helping fast-growing clouds accelerate enterprise deals.

Founded in 2024 and launched in 2025, Datum is based in New York City and backed by some really cool investors. Onwards!
