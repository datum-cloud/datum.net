Datum’s core value is a cloud platform optimized for network and data heavy workloads. At the heart of all of our product experiences are two elements:
- A control plane for managing resources and operational tasks
- A global network infrastructure footprint for aggregation, connections, etc

On top of this foundation we offer the following distinct product capabilities:
- Runtime - Core network services delivered on our global edge
- Connections - Secure connectivity to your infra, providers, partners and end users
- Workflows - Automations to improve reliability and customize behavior
- Assets - Programmatic resources to support your deployments

Since Datum is backed by open source, we’re interested in both transparency as well as extensibility. While we’re currently focused on delivering a managed cloud experience, users can run data plane workloads in their own clouds, or on various public clouds.
