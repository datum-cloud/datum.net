Over the last 25 years, our team has built a dozen internet-scale cloud platforms from scratch, from the first Linux-based hosting company (Voxel) to bare metal and edge providers like Packet, SoftLayer, and Stackpath.

Along the way, we scraped our hands on cage nuts, borrowed IP space from our neighborhood ISP, showed up in IX’s and meet-me rooms around the world, and figured out how to light our own dark fiber. In short, we had to make the internet “go” just to show up to the game.

Because of this, we know that underneath every hyperscale cloud is a laundry list of capabilities that most builders have never heard of: interconnection, private backbones, ASNs, global edge infrastructure, authoritative DNS, etc.

As the AI boom took hold, we saw the potential for millions of new builders and thousands of new clouds to innovate at scale. So we asked: why can't everyone have access to the same, powerful toolset that quite literally connects our digital world?

That's why Datum exists.

To help 1000 new clouds thrive in the age of AI by arming them with the internet superpowers all the big guys have:
- A global edge to meet the internet at scale
- Your own private backbones to route traffic off the public internet
- Enterprise-grade DNS and domain management
- Full packet capture with OTel-compatible telemetry
- Native integration into your existing workflows
- All without leaving your IDE or cluster.

What used to take years of build out, we want to help you do in minutes, from Cursor, Claude or Kubernetes. Onwards!
