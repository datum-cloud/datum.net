Users can register and authenticate into Datum Cloud with either Google or GitHub credentials. We do not offer username/email and password based accounts.

## We think this is convenient for users
It greatly reduces frictions, support, and surface area.

## Passkeys
We love passkeys. Please add one so you can login securely without messing with clunky 2FA.

## Force Google Login
If you are the owner or admin of a Standard Organization, you can choose to enforce Google logins for your verified domain. This can be mighty helpful for onboarding and offboarding users.
