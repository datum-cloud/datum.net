Standard Organizations enable teams to collaborate on projects, share resources, and centralize management. 

When you first sign up for Datum Cloud, you receive a Personal Organization automatically. To collaborate with team members, you'll need to create or join a Standard Organization. Standard Organizations provide:
- Centralized resource management across team members
- Persistent access to all assets created within the organization
- Basic role-based access control
- Team collaboration on projects and infrastructure

Standard Organizations support the following coarse-grained roles: 
- Owners - Full control over the organization and all resources.
- Editors - Control over all resources in an organization, except for team members.
- Viewer - Read only access to all resources in an organization. No edit or action ability.
