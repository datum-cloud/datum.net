Datum is focused on helping the next 1k clouds thrive in the age of AI. One of the downstreams impacts of this mission is that we aren’t super excited about restricting features.

Similar to public cloud platforms, you’ll find that we make “enterprise” capabilities available on all tiers, so you can adopt best practices no matter your scale.
