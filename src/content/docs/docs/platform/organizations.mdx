Orgs sound boring, but they really are quite important. There are two types of orgs at Datum:
- Personal Orgs - After signup, a personal org is automatically created on your behalf. Personal orgs are great for solo experimentation, and play a role in our data model.
- Standard Orgs - You can create additional orgs, to which you can invite members, leverage role-based access controls, etc.

We recommend that you think about your Personal Org as a sandbox. While there is nothing to stop you from running “production” workloads in your personal org

Why do we auto create you a Personal Org? Essentially, this is tied to our data model, where for each user we need an organizational entity that is uniquely tied to a user. This allows you to participate in (and then be removed from) any Standard organization without losing access to Datum Cloud. While we could hide this org entity from you, we prefer to give you a personal playground. Enjoy!
