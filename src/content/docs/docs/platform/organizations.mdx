The organization resource is the root node in Datum Cloud’s resource hierarchy. We support two types of organizations:

**Personal Organization** - Designed for personal projects and experimentation.
- Access to most platform features.
- Cannot have additional team members
- Restricted to free “Builder” tier. No ability to upgrade to a higher level of service.

**Standard Organization** - Designed for team collaboration and production use cases. 
- Access to all platform features
- Ability to add/manage team members with Owner, Editor or Viewer roles
- Ability to upgrade to paid tiers when available.
