## Empowering Builders in the AI Age
Datum’s mission is to help 1000 new clouds thrive in the age of AI. That’s why we’re bringing the “internet superpowers” that all the big guys use into the tools that builders love, like Cursor and Kubernetes.

Let’s get you started!

## Getting Started: Authentication & Core Concepts
While machine accounts might do all the work at scale, we need to know the humans on our platform. As such, your first step is to create a user account at https://cloud.datum.net.

You will be asked to use a Google or a GitHub account for authentication. Choose either!
Your Datum account will be associated with the primary email on your social account.
We do not accept email and password registrations.

Once you’ve created your account, you’ll benefit from understanding a few things:
- [Organizations](/docs/platform/organizations/) - A way to group your projects, control billing and manage access.
- [Projects](/docs/platform/projects/) - How you organize work on Datum Cloud.
- [Datum MCP](/docs/quickstart/datum-mcp/) - Install and manage in your favorite tool (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.).
- [datumctl](/docs/quickstart/datumctl/) - Interact with Datum in a familiar, Kubernetes-native way.
