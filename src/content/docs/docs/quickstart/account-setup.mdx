As always, the first step is to create a user account! You can do this at https://cloud.datum.net.

- You will be asked to use a Google or a GitHub account for authentication. 
- Your Datum account will be associated with the primary email on your social account.
- We do not accept email and password registrations.

_Note: Datum Cloud is currently accepting registrations for its free “Builder Tier” on a waitlist basis. Follow the instructions and you’ll be notified as soon as you can access the platform._

Once you’ve created a user account, feel free to personalize your experience a bit (avatar, portal preferences, etc). Just click on your initials at the top right of your screen.

If you want to do anything interesting, however, you’ll need an Organization and a Project. 

- Organizations are the resource for managing projects, billing and team access 
- Projects, which are nested below Orgs, are where all work takes place

By default, each user receives a Personal Organization, which does not support collaboration and cannot be renamed. Consider this your personal sandbox. If you wish to collaborate with others, simply create a new Standard Organization by providing a description and unique resource name.

Create a project within any Organization to complete the basic setup.
