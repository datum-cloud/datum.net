As you begin working with Datum, it’s helpful to understand some key decisions we’ve made.

**Kubernetes CRDs** - Datum’s control plane is built on Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). While you don’t have to use k8s to use Datum Cloud, it helps to understand what’s under the hood.

- Ecosystem - We’ve invested in this approach to align with the largest ecosystem for cloud operators. If you’re a cloud native SRE or platform engineer, working with Datum capabilities exposed as resources should feel super comfy.
- LLMs - Because Kubernetes patterns are so well established, LLMs are able to more easily and accurately interact with Datum’s platform.

**Locations** - We deploy infrastructure in the top internet aggregation points globally. To learn more about how we translate that infrastructure into customer-facing regions and zones, check out the [Infrastructure](../../infrastructure/) section later in these docs.

**Customer Portal** - Our portal is organized into three main areas: account settings, organization settings, and project settings. Aside from team management, which takes place at the Org level, most resources are managed at the Project level:
- Runtime Core network services delivered on Datum’s global edge, including:
  - DNS - An authoritative DNS service backed by PowerDNS & Hickory DNS
  - Proxy - An Envoy-based proxy to secure and accelerate apps and services
  - AI Gateway - A globally distributed gateway for interacting with GenAI services
- Connections - Securely interact with infra, providers, partners and customers
  - Galactic VPC -  Private Internet backbones that span clouds with policy controls
  - Tunnel - Access to any system. No dynamic DNS, no port forwarding, no VPNs.
- Workflows - Automations to improve reliability and customize behavior
  - 1-Click WAF - Standard OWASP rules through your proxy. Powered by Coraza.
  - Grafana Cloud - Send OTel telemetry to Grafana Cloud using an export policy.
- Assets - Programmatic resources to support your deployments
  - Domains - A programmatic resource for organizing and managing domains
  - Secrets - Credential management service for sensitive data
