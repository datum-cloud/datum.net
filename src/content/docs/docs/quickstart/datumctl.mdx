datumctl is our CLI for managing Datum Cloud resources via the command line. It provides authorization, API management, and has the ability to manage .kubeconfig files so that you can leverage kubectl for day to day interaction with Datum Cloud.

Let’s assume that you have a working set of Kubernetes command line tools installed on your system, especially \`kubectl\` (which is used to apply resources to the cluster and to inspect the status of work as it happens). In addition, we’ll note that if you want or need to build our tooling from scratch you’ll want to have a Go compiler available. 

## Installing datumctl
datumctl is straightforward to install from prebuilt binaries on many systems, and since it’s open source, you can build it from scratch if that suits your needs. 

### Mac with Homebrew

Use the Homebrew package manager to install datumctl.
```
brew install datum-cloud/tap/datumctl
```

### Linux with curl

_Warning this script does not work on arm64 systems, needs some sed to modify $ARCH_
```
export OS=$(uname -s)
export ARCH=$(uname -m)

curl -Lo ./datumctl.tar.gz https://github.com/datum-cloud/datumctl/releases/latest/download/datumctl_${OS}_${ARCH}.tar.gz
tar zxvf datumctl.tar.gz datumctl
chmod +x datumctl
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
mv ./datumctl ~/.local/bin/datumctl
```

### Go with Go [v1.XX](http://v1.xx)+

You must have Go version [1.XX](http://1.xx) or better for this to work as expected. 
```
go install go.datum.net/datumctl@latest
# Ensure that $GOPATH/bin is in your PATH
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

### Windows Powershell

Install datumctl on Windows using PowerShell

```shell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/datum-cloud/datumctl/releases/latest/download/datumctl_Windows_x86_64.zip" - OutFile "datumctl.zip"
Expand-Archive -Path "datumctl.zip" -DestinationPath "datumctl"
```

Move the `datumctl.exe` file to a directory in your `PATH` or simply run it from the current directory:

```shell
.\datumctl\datumctl.exe
```
