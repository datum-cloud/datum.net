## What an ALIAS record is

An **ALIAS** record is a provider-side feature that lets you point a hostname (including the **zone apex**, like `example.com`) at another hostname the way a CNAME does, while still returning **A/AAAA answers** to clients.

Different providers use different names for the same idea:

- **Cloudflare** commonly describes this as **“CNAME flattening”**
- Other DNS providers may call it **ALIAS**, **ANAME**, or **flattened CNAME**

## When you should use ALIAS

Use ALIAS when you want “point this name at that hostname” behavior but **you can’t (or shouldn’t) use CNAME**, most commonly:

- At the **zone apex** (`example.com`) where CNAME is not allowed by standard DNS rules.
- When you want the convenience of targeting a hostname that may change IPs (CDNs, hosted services), but still need clients to receive A/AAAA records.

## Expected Name and Value

- **Name**: the hostname inside the zone you’re creating the record for.
  - For the zone apex, many DNS tools use `@` (BIND/zone-file notation) to mean “the zone root”.
  - For a subdomain, use the label (for example `www` for `www.example.com`).
- **Value**: a **target hostname (FQDN)**, like `myapp.hosting-provider.com`.
  - ALIAS values should be **hostnames**, not IP addresses.
  - The target hostname should ultimately resolve to **A and/or AAAA** records (directly or through other DNS indirection).

## How it works (what it does)

ALIAS does **not** exist as a standardized DNS RRType that recursive resolvers understand everywhere. Instead, the DNS provider’s authoritative system does the work:

1. A client’s recursive resolver asks for `A` and/or `AAAA` for the ALIAS name (for example `example.com`).
2. Datum resolves the ALIAS target hostname (for example `myapp.hosting-provider.com`) to its current `A`/`AAAA` records.
3. Datum returns the resulting `A`/`AAAA` answers **as if they were directly configured on the ALIAS name**.

Important consequence: clients typically **do not** see a CNAME in the response. They see `A`/`AAAA` records for the name they queried.

## What to expect compared to CNAME

- **CNAME**: returns a CNAME response and relies on the resolver to chase it.
- **ALIAS / “CNAME flattening”**: returns `A`/`AAAA` directly (synthesized by the DNS provider).

## Notes and limitations

- **Portability**: ALIAS/flattening is not uniform across providers. If you move DNS providers, you may need to translate this into whatever equivalent that provider supports.
- **Answer types**: ALIAS is primarily about synthesizing `A`/`AAAA` answers. It is not a general replacement for other record types.
