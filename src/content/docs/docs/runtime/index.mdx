We love to build global edge networks, so as soon as we got some VC money we called up our friends and got infrastructure in enough global locations to satisfy our need for speed.  Or rather, our need for reduced latency from end users and to major public clouds, as well as geographic resiliency.

In theory we could let users deploy anything and everything on our edge, but that’s not really our focus. Right now our edge is designed for network-focused workloads. That’s why we’ve created a some curated services that run best at the edge of the network.
