Simplify how you protect and route internet traffic to your backend services. Datum’s Proxy is a streamlined, single-manifest approach that automatically manages the hard stuff.

1. **Portal Management UI** – View, setup and manage Proxy resources via the portal. Edit backend endpoints and host name/s after creation.
2. **Enhanced Status Visibility** – Display status information including: Programmed status "Accepted" and "Programmed", Generated hostname(s), Custom hostname verification status, …
3. **Cloud Portal Traffic Metrics** - Filtered by region: Global Upstream Latency Percentile, Regional Upstream RPS,  Regional Upstream Response and Errors.
4. **DNS & Domain Integration** – Integration with Domain resources for custom hostname configuration, including: Visual indication of verification status, Quick links to related Domain resources, Clear messaging for unverified hostnames.
5. **Endpoint Failover with Passive Health Checks** – Track errors at origin and failover to backup when failure threshold is crossed.
6. **Path Configuration** - Determine how incoming requests are matched and routed based on their URL paths.
7. **Audit Log** – Track and expose all events (create/update/delete, hostname changes, backend modifications, programming status changes) for audit and compliance.

**Protocols** - We support HTTP(S) 1.1, HTTP2, gRPC, and WebSockets.
