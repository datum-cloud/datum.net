Internet-facing applications are exposed to common attacks the moment they get online. Our “1-Click WAF” workflow (powered by Coraza) enforces the OWASP Core Rule Set on a Datum Proxy (or multiple proxies), providing a great option that doesn’t require deep security expertise.

Benefits:
- Provide baseline security protection for applications exposed on the internet
- Block common attack patterns (XSS, SQLi, RCE, etc.) before they reach application services
- Reduce operational risk and incident load by catching attacks early
