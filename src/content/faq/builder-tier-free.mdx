Yes, the Builder tier will always remain free. It's designed for personal projects, development, and experimentation. It includes access to our Runtime services (DNS, Proxy, AI Gateway), Connections (Tunnels, VPNs), Workflows (1-Click WAF, Metrics Export), Assets management (Domains, Secrets), and team collaboration features with RBAC and Machine Accounts. We're committed to keeping this tier free to support the developer community and enable innovation without financial barriers.
