The Provider tier is a high-touch offering designed specifically for alternative cloud providers looking to grow revenue and scale their infrastructure. It includes everything in the Scaler plan plus dedicated namespace, private virtual backbones, custom AnyCAST and IP space, up to 45 global edge locations, certificate management, Domain Connect, and premium support with Slack access. Pricing starts from $2,500/month (probably!). To discuss your specific needs and get a custom quote, we recommend meeting with one of our founders.
