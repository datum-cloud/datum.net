This tier is designed for "alt cloud" providers that deliver their value directly on top of connected infrastructure. While we're not 100% certain of the pricing structure just yet, our goal is provide a curated set of services that help alt clouds grow their revenue and scale across diverse infrastructures. To learn more about what we're thinking, please schedule time with one of our founders.
