The Scaler tier is coming in 2026. It's designed for production applications that need to scale and interact with cloud services. Beyond everything in the Builder tier, Scaler adds Galactic VPC, ecosystem connections to AWS & GCP, SSL for SaaS with unlimited certificates, fine-grained permissions with SSO support, uptime SLAs, and 24/7 email support. It starts at $25/month plus traffic usage, and includes $10 in usage credits to get you started.
