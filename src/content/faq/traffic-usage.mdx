question: "What does \"traffic usage\" mean for the Scaler tier pricing?"
order: 3
category: "pricing"
---

The Scaler tier uses a pay-as-you-grow model with a base price of $20/month plus additional charges based on your actual traffic usage. This means you only pay for what you use beyond the base tier. The plan includes $10 in usage credits to help offset initial traffic costs, making it cost-effective for growing applications while ensuring you have the resources you need as your user base expands.
