Datum is venture-backed startup reimagining the internet for AI. We have our headquarters in New York City, but our team lives and works around the world, from Texas and Los Angeles to Argentina and Indonesia. 

While the company was incorporated in 2023, we didn’t start active development until late 2024.

Datum was born from the experience our founders had building and scaling infrastructure companies like Packet (acquired by Equinix), StackPath, SoftLayer, zScaler, and others.

We saw firsthand how even the best teams struggled to interact with the superpowers that underpin the internet: authoritative DNS, distributed proxies, global backbones, deterministic routing, cloud on-ramps, private interconnection, etc. This challenge is even more extreme for cloud-native developers and the next generation of builders unleashed by AI.

## The founding insight
With workload and data being distributed everywhere, regulation becoming more complex, and security concerns skyrocketing, it was clear that an entire generation was working with at least one hand tied behind their backs. 

So we asked ourselves: what if we could give every new builder access to the internet superpowers that only the big guys have today, and do it in the tools they already use, like Cursor and Kubernetes. 

That’s why we started Datum: to help 1k new clouds thrive in the age of AI by unlocking internet superpowers for the next generation of builders.

## So what does good look like?
- We like to say that we’re working to reimagine the internet for AI. At the very least, it’s clear that the internet needs an upgrade, and maybe a return to its roots. Here’s how we see it:
- We need an internet that is deterministic, flexible, programmatic and secure.
- We need an internet that can be leveraged without physical builds and low level networking expertise.
- We need to replace the current “telco style” interface with one designed for software, developers, and autonomous systems.
- We need to build for the complexity, risks, and opportunities of AI.  
- We need a neutral operator that can update the collaborative, open architecture of the original internet for today’s needs.
