Datum is venture-backed startup reimagining the internet for the AI era. 

While the company was incorporated in 2023, we started active development in late 2024. We have our headquarters in New York City (right across from Trinity Church in Lower Manhattan), but our team lives and works around the world, from Texas and California to Argentina and Indonesia. 

Datum was born from the experience our founders had building and scaling infrastructure companies like Packet (acquired by Equinix), Voxel, StackPath, SoftLayer, zScaler, and others. We saw firsthand how even the best teams struggled to interact with the superpowers that underpin the internet: authoritative DNS, distributed proxies, global backbones, deterministic routing, cloud on-ramps, private interconnection, etc. This challenge is even more extreme for cloud-native developers and the next generation of builders unleashed by AI. 

With workload and data being distributed everywhere, regulation becoming more complex (the “splinternet!”), and security concerns skyrocketing, it was clear that an entire generation was working with at least one hand tied behind their backs. 

So we asked ourselves: what if we could give every new builder access to the internet superpowers that the big guys have today, and do it in the tools they already use, like Cursor and Kubernetes? 

That’s why we started Datum: to help ~1k new clouds thrive in the AI era by unlocking internet superpowers for the next generation of builders.
