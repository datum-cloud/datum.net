At the highest level, Datum’s economic model includes consumption-based usage of our network cloud infrastructure; orchestrating interactions between cloud, SaaS, and enterprise participants in virtual “meet me” rooms; and managing virtual global backbones for scaled provider and SaaS customers. 
Ultimately, we make money when an ecosystem thrives on our platform. Our business model aligns our success with our customers’ success.
While our pricing is early and will likely evolve, here are some guiding principles we use: 
* Transparent, predictable pricing that scales with value delivered
* No margin stacking on partner solutions
* Free tiers that help builders experiment and learn
* Broad access to enterprise features (cloud not SaaS)
