Datum’s economic model includes consumption-based usage of our network infrastructure; orchestrating interactions between cloud, SaaS, and enterprise participants in virtual “meet me” rooms; and managing virtual global backbones for scaled provider and SaaS customers. 

Ultimately, we make money when an ecosystem thrives on our platform. Our business model aligns our success with our customers’ success.

Pricing philosophy:
- Transparent, predictable pricing that scales with value delivered
- No margin stacking on partner solutions
- Free tiers that let developers experiment and learn
