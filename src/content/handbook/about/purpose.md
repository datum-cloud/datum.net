We believe that most people devote their time, energy, families, reputations and money to something not because of what it does, but why it exists and what it believes about the world. When we introduce Datum to prospective users, customers, investors, partners or employees, here is what we share.

## Values
Who we are:
* We are connectors — of people, businesses, apps and networks
* We are operators at heart 
* We are passionate about working in the open

How we act:
* We find creative answers to hard problems
* We prioritize outcomes for users, customers, and partners
* We write our own words

## Focus & Niche
The next thing we share is our [Hedgehog concept](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-hedgehog-concept.html), which was articulated by Jim Collins in his iconic book Good to Great. Similar to the Japanese concept of [ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai), the Hedgehog concept is the intersection of three circles: 1) what you are deeply passionate about, 2) what you can be the best in the world at, and 3) what best drives your economic or resource engine.
* **Our Purpose/Cause/Passion** - Helping 1k new clouds thrive in the AI era.
* **Our “best in the world” niche** - We unlock internet superpowers for builders
* **Economic Engine** - We are the best way for "alt cloud" providers to interact.

## 10 Year Target
Many companies rally around a "north star" or a "big, hairy audacious goal" (B.H.A.G.). Ours is to be the most trusted way for AI & digital ecosystems to interact (w/ millions of active connections to prove it).
