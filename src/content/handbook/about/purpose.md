We believe that most people devote their time, energy, families, reputations and money to something not because of what it does, but why it exists and what it believes about the world. When we introduce Datum to prospective users, customers, investors, partners or employees, here is what we share.

## Values
* We are connectors — of people, businesses, apps and networks. ABCD!
* We are operators at heart who know how to get stuff done.
* We build for scale with thoughtful abstractions. "Our future selves will thank us."
* We believe that “open” is better, software is the customer, and partners have real value.
* We value grit, humility and hunger. 

## Focus & Niche
The next thing we share is our [Hedgehog concept](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-hedgehog-concept.html), which was articulated by Jim Collins in his iconic book Good to Great. Similar to the Japanese concept of [ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai), the Hedgehog concept is the intersection of three circles: 1) what you are deeply passionate about, 2) what you can be the best in the world at, and 3) what best drives your economic or resource engine.
