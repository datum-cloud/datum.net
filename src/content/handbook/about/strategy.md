If you’ve read any business books over the last twenty years, you know about BHAG’s. Our big, hairy, audacious goal (BHAG) is to be the most trusted way for AI & digital ecosystems to interact. We think we’ll need w/ millions, or even billions, of active connections to prove it.

Essentially, this describes a network effect, which is a notoriously difficult thing to kickstart! 

To get there, we’re inspired by the original concept of the internet, which was based on a collaborative, open architecture. To update this concept in an age of AI and complex digital ecosystems, we are building the world’s first truly open network cloud, backed by open source.

We’re building Datum Cloud as open source with AGPLv3 licensing because we believe transparency and community are essential for infrastructure that people depend on.

Why open source matters for us:
- Trust - Our customers can see exactly what they’re running and how it works
- No lock-in - You can run Datum Cloud anywhere - our cloud, your cloud, or on-premises
- Community innovation - The best solutions come from diverse contributors solving real problems
- Neutrality - Open source reinforces our position as a neutral operator, not a competitor

Our open source commitment:
- Core Datum Cloud functionality is fully open source
- [Community contributions](https://github.com/orgs/datum-cloud/discussions/categories/feature-requests) are welcomed and celebrated 
- [Documentation](https://www.datum.net/docs/) and examples are extensive and maintained
- We provide clear paths for both self-hosted and managed deployments

We’re building Datum to be genuinely neutral because providers need a place to collaborate without competitive dynamics. We believe we succeed when our ecosystem partners succeed, so that means:
- No margin stacking - We use transparent, rebill-style commercial models
- Partner-first mindset - We’re designed to amplify your differentiation, not compete with it
- Open ecosystem - We connect providers with their unique ecosystem advantage
- Technology agnostic - We support diverse technology partners and their preferred channels.
