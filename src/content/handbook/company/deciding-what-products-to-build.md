Datum is the neutral, open network cloud designed to power the next 1,000 hyperscalers.

Our passion is connecting fragmented ecosystems across clouds, providers, and enterprisesâ€”giving builders the programmatic control, performance, and observability they need to operate in an AI-native world.

With an open source foundation and a business model built on the success of partners, we connect providers with their unique ecosystem advantage, so they can play to win.
