## Born different
Datum was born from the experience of building and scaling infrastructure companies like Packet (acquired by Equinix). We saw firsthand how the best teams get stuck stitching together complex infrastructure instead of focusing on their core differentiation.

The founding insight: What if we could give every innovative company the networking superpowers that only hyperscalers have today?

## Key moments in our journey
- Recognized the growing abstraction gap between developers and networking
- Understood that AI would accelerate this complexity exponentially  
- Saw the opportunity to update the collaborative, open architecture of the original internet
- Decided to build neutral infrastructure that serves providers, not competes with them
- Committed to open source as the foundation for trust and community
