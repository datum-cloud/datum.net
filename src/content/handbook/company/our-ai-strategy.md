We're not just building for the current internet - we're building the internet that AI needs.

## AI is changing everything
- **Complexity explosion** - AI workloads are more distributed, data-intensive, and performance-sensitive
- **New interfaces** - AI agents need programmatic, reasoning-friendly interfaces to infrastructure
- **Ecosystem importance** - AI leaders win by orchestrating powerful ecosystems, not building everything themselves
- **Global requirements** - AI services need to run everywhere with deterministic performance

## How we're building for AI
- **AI-native interfaces** - Our platform speaks the language of modern AI systems and agents
- **Intelligent routing** - AI-driven traffic optimization and policy enforcement
- **Ecosystem orchestration** - Seamless connection between AI providers, cloud platforms, and enterprise customers
- **Performance guarantees** - Deterministic routing and observability for mission-critical AI workloads

Our 10-year target: The most trusted way for AI and digital ecosystems to interact (with millions of active connections to prove it).
