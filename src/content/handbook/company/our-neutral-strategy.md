Unlike hyperscale clouds that want to lock you into their ecosystem, we're building Datum to be genuinely neutral. We succeed when our ecosystem partners succeed.

## What neutral means
- **No margin stacking** - We use transparent, rebill-style commercial models
- **Partner-first mindset** - We're designed to amplify your differentiation, not compete with it
- **Open ecosystem** - We connect providers with their unique ecosystem advantage
- **Technology agnostic** - We support diverse technology partners and their channels

## Why neutrality is our strategy
- The market needs a "Switzerland" for digital infrastructure
- Providers need a place to collaborate without competitive dynamics
- Innovation happens when different technologies can work together seamlessly
- Trust is earned by consistently acting in everyone's best interest
