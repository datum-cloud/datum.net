  description: "Learn why Datum Cloud is fully open source - built for trust, transparency, and community with AGPLv3 licensing. Discover our commitment to no lock-in, neutrality, and community-driven innovation, plus extensive documentation and contributor paths."

We're building Datum Cloud as open source with AGPLv3 licensing because we believe transparency and community are essential for infrastructure that people depend on. 

## Why open source matters for us
- **Trust** - Our customers can see exactly what they're running and how it works
- **No lock-in** - You can run Datum Cloud anywhere - our cloud, your cloud, or on-premises
- **Community innovation** - The best solutions come from diverse contributors solving real problems
- **Neutrality** - Open source reinforces our position as a neutral operator, not a competitor

## Our open source commitment
- Core Datum Cloud functionality is fully open source
- Community contributions are welcomed and celebrated
- Documentation and examples are extensive and maintained
- We provide clear paths for both self-hosted and managed deployments

By 2027, we aim to have 150+ open source contributors actively improving the platform.
