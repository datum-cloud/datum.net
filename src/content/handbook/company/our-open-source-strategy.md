We're building Datum Cloud as open source with AGPLv3 licensing because we believe transparency and community are essential for infrastructure that people depend on. 

**Why open source matters for us:**
- **Trust** - Our customers can see exactly what they're running and how it works
- **No lock-in** - You can run Datum Cloud anywhere - our cloud, your cloud, or on-premises
- **Community innovation** - The best solutions come from diverse contributors solving real problems
- **Neutrality** - Open source reinforces our position as a neutral operator, not a competitor

**Our open source commitment:**
- Core Datum Cloud functionality is fully open source
- Community contributions are welcomed and celebrated
- Documentation and examples are extensive and maintained
- We provide clear paths for both self-hosted and managed deployments

By 2027, we aim to have 150+ open source contributors actively improving the platform.
