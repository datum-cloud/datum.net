## We are connectors
— of people, businesses, apps and networks. At our core, we believe in creating bridges where others build walls.

## We are operators
at heart who know how to get stuff done. We don't just theorize; we build, ship, and scale.

## We value grit, humility and hunger
We welcome bold ideas and reject inertia, but also embrace empathy and continuous learning.

## We invest in relationships
We operate with honesty and look for savvy yet humble people who can't help but act like owners.
