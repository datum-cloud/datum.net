## The original internet 
We're inspired by the collaborative, open architecture that built the foundation of our digital world. We want to update that vision for the AI era.

## The next 1,000 hyperscalers
Every important business needs infrastructure superpowers to compete. We want to democratize access to those capabilities.

## Developer empowerment
The best solutions come from empowering smart people to solve their own problems, not prescribing one-size-fits-all solutions.

## Ecosystem thinking
The companies that win long-term sit at the center of powerful, value-creating ecosystems.
