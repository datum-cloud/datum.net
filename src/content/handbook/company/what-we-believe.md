## Open is better
We believe in the power of open source to build trust, enable innovation, and serve the "non bell curve" crowd. Our products are backed by AGPLv3 licenses so users can invest confidently and adapt as needed.

## Software is the customer
We design for developers who think in code, not infrastructure engineers stuck in the telco era. Everything should be programmable, accessible, and AI-native.

## Partners have real value
We're not trying to replace everything. We're building a neutral ecosystem where the best providers can thrive and connect with their customers.

## Differentiation matters
While public clouds focus on 80% "bell curve" use cases, we serve the providers who need to drive differentiation in price, performance, features, timing, and reach.
