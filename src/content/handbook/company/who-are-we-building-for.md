## The customers
Our customers are **AI-native providers and digital leaders**: AI startups, alt clouds ([we made a constantly updated list](https://github.com/datum-cloud/awesome-alt-clouds)), and next-gen enterprises who are building what's next. They're focused on innovation, speed to market, and making the future possible.

These are companies like Vercel, Snowflake, Roblox, Palo Alto Networks, Hugging Face, Datadog, American Express, Databricks, and Walmart - providers who want to drive differentiation or meet increasingly complex regulatory requirements.

## They need to
- Acquire "hyperscaler" infrastructure advantages
- Efficiently operate connected cloud experiences at scale, globally and across diverse environments
- Securely connect a fragmented ecosystem: 10's of cloud regions, 100's of partners, 1000's of customers
- Have end-to-end observability across clouds and providers, using their standard tooling
- React to increasingly complex regulatory, security, privacy, performance, and business requirements
- Evolve alongside AI and interact with infrastructure using reasoning and AI-native concepts
