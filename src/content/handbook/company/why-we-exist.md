## Our "why"
We're convinced that basically every important business going forward will be digital, and will require "hyperscaler" or "modern service provider" advantages to truly compete and win. However, most companies simply don't have the capabilities, the resources, the relationships, or the time to do it all. We believe we can help 1-2k of them play to win. This is our "why".

## Developers need open access to networking
Over the last cycle, developers were abstracted from the lowest, most critical layers of networking. Powerful capabilities like private connectivity, peering, and deterministic routing are now basically invisible to them, with a high barrier to entry and an interface stuck in the telco era. At the same time, our software-driven world is getting more complex and fragmented right alongside a rapid increase in the value of connected, data-aware global experiences.

We think developers need networking superpowers to build the best version of the future and connect securely with the partners, providers, applications, and customers that help them win. Our mission is to make it happen.
