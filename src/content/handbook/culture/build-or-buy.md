One of the more difficult decisions at Datum centers around what not to build. We take this very seriously, but it’s not a simple thing.

## What not to build (MIlo edition)

The most obvious examples are related to Milo, our “system of action” for Alt Clouds. As the first consumers of Milo, we have a huge dependency on this project as well as a strong echo chamber. Our strategy with Milo is to offer an integrated and opinionated system, so it is alluring to embrace a “build everything” approach. 

## What not to build 

We try to take a humble stance with Datum Cloud. Our job is mainly to be excellent operators of technology, not the innovators of every bit of the stack.

From DNS to storage to serverless compute, we’re quite reliant on an ecosystem.
