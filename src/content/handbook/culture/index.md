We’re a company that believes in transparency and autonomy. Each team member is empowered to make decisions in their domain and drive projects forward.

## Core principles:
* Remote-first - We’re designed for distributed work across time zones
* Async-first - We default to written communication and recorded decisions
* Autonomy with alignment - Clear goals and context, with freedom to execute
* Transparent by default - Things are open unless there’s a reason to keep it private

We believe in respecting each other’s time, enabling deep focus, and building a culture where thoughtful communication beats instant responses. Here’s how we make it work: 
* There’s a slack channel for just about everything and everyone 
* We respect time and focus. Async doesn’t mean always-on. 
* Protect deep work and personal balance (no @channels here!) 
* We have regularly scheduled syncs, but leave time for adhoc catchups
* Keep it human. Remember the person behind every message.
* Understand each modality, its benefits and costs: async, real time video, in person, etc.

We trust our team to make the right decisions and focus on the right priorities, but we also believe that being intentional really does produce better outcomes. 

## How we show up 
* Work in the open when possible. Public channels and GitHub issues are our jam!
* Assume positive intent. Start from a place of trust in every conversation.
* Celebrate impact, not hours. We value outcomes over time spent.
* Share what you learn. Spread knowledge across the team.
* Lift others up. Celebrate wins big and small.

## How we work together 
* Be curious. Ask questions and learn continuously.
* Be kind. Disagree respectfully — collaboration thrives on empathy.
* Be accountable. Own your work and follow through.
* Be flexible. Great ideas can come from anywhere — adapt and grow.
