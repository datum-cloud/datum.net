Our strategy is centered around transparency, and the most important part of this is doing our work in the open. For many folks, this is a new muscle. 

The most important tip is to think about anything you need or want to do, and look for any reasons why it should not be done in the open by default. Clearly there are important things that should be private, for instance anything to do with customer or employee privacy, detailed financials, or not-yet announced partnerships. 

A key behavior that we try to encourage is to move all strategic and product conversations from private or isolated channels into public GitHub Discussions. This helps our team, community and customers participate in charting the course of our company.
