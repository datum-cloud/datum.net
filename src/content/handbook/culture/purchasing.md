We trust team members to spend money responsibly on behalf of the company. As such, our spending caps below (enforced via Ramp, our expense management tool) are not hard limits, but guardrails. In general, we ask that each employee act like an owner and spend company money like it's your own. When in doubt, just ask! 

**The basics** - All US-based employees receive a Ramp card for business related expenses, which should be used whenever possible. If you do use another payment method, you’ll need to use Ramp to upload documentation for reimbursement. Here are some basic rules of the road: 
* Use your Ramp card for all approved business expenses. No personal purchases!  
* If you lose your card, let the Head of Finance and Ramp know ASAP
* Upload receipts (required for expenses >$25) within 10 days.
* Please add a note about the purchase so we can code it properly. Darn that accounting!

**Spending guidelines** - It’s important that we use trusted vendors and get the most value for our money. Spending limits help us with both of these goals. Here are the rules: 
* Under $500: Use your judgment
* $500-$2,000: Get your manager’s approval
* Over $2,000: Needs finance team review (for travel, see travel policy)
* Recurring subscriptions: Always get approval first

No approval is needed for customer meals (keep reasonable, note who attended) or for basic transportation for business meetings. Check with a manager for anything over $500, including: 
* Conference or event fees
* Software purchases and SaaS subscriptions
* Team dinners, retreats, and outings
* Computer equipment, monitors, keyboards

And there are a number of things for which we don’t reimburse:
* Premium economy, business, or first-class flights without prior approval
* Excessive meal costs
* Personal entertainment, shopping, grooming
* Minibar charges at hotels
* Personal travel extensions
* Commuting to/from office
* Parking tickets and traffic violations

**A note for our teammates outside the United States** - If you’re outside of the US or working on a contractor basis, then all expenses must be approved in advance by your manager. Add expenses as separate line items on your monthly invoice and attach receipts.
