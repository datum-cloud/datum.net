In line with our ethos of working in the open, surfing across time zones, and serving builders, we try to do our work in places that can be visible to others and are naturally well documented.

* **GitHub** - This is a core repository for work across teams, and we try to use it for everything possible. Code, of course, lives in GitHub, but so do our planning and many of our communications mechanisms (such as GitHub discussions for processing feedback and memorializing our work in changelog posts.)

* **Website** - We see our [datum.net](http://datum.net) website as the “front door” and jumping off point for internal and external users, community members, partners, and customers. We feed important info (such as roadmap and changelog content) from GitHub back into our website, and are working hard to build a rhythm with this public handbook, events, brand guidelines and other resources. When in doubt, check the website!
 
* **Slack & Discord** - We find that both are necessary. Slack is used heavily for internal communication and collaboration and we embrace shared channels with other Slack workspaces wherever possible. Discord, on the other hand, is where we can more openly work with our community members.

* **Cursor, Claude, and Friends** - Tooling is very much in flux in this realm, so we leverage an “organized chaos” approach. Team members are encouraged to use the tools that suit them best, and then we work to aggregate demand as patterns congeal.

* **Milo** - In addition to using a number of core external tools, we are also building a lot of software (in the open) that is specific to operating a cloud service. This is mainly focused around a system of record, staff portal, and core workflows around users and customers, but we’re still feeling our way regarding what we build and what we buy.
