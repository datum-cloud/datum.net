GitHub is a critical piece of infrastructure and a daily working environment for everyone on our team. We use it in the following ways:

- As a code repository for all public projects (Datum, Milo, and related) as well as private projects (stuff that we use to run Datum Cloud)

- To organize our work, from releases down to enhancements and issues

- To drive content on our website, including docs, handbook, changelog, roadmap, etc.

- To power our internal wiki

- To organize our work within and across teams

- To solicit new ideas and debate the options, via GitHub Discussions

As a central tool for our team, every team member at Datum is expected to embrace a solid dash of markdown. Of course, GitHub is confusing as heck sometimes, so we’re happy to help everyone get up to speed with its inner workings as part of onboarding.

Here are a few useful tips:

1. If you want to suggest a new feature

2. If you want to report a bug

3. If you want to know what’s being worked on

4. If you want to review recent changes

We ask our Engineering team to curate the Enhancements and Release aspects.
