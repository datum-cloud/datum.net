## 6w2w
We work in 6-week cycles with 2-week cool-downs, inspired by Basecamp's Shape Up methodology.

## Cycle structure
- 6 weeks building - Focus on one major project per person/team
- 2 weeks cool-down - Bug fixes, exploration, planning next cycle
- Planning week - Shape work for next cycle, assign teams

## Planning principles
- Shape work before assigning it
- Give teams uninterrupted focus time
- Solve real customer problems
- Iterate based on usage and feedback
