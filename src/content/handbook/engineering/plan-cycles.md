We work in 6-week cycles with 2-week cool-downs, inspired by Basecamp's Shape Up methodology.

**Cycle structure:**
- **6 weeks building** - Focus on one major project per person/team
- **2 weeks cool-down** - Bug fixes, exploration, planning next cycle
- **Planning week** - Shape work for next cycle, assign teams

**Planning principles:**
- Shape work before assigning it
- Give teams uninterrupted focus time
- Solve real customer problems
- Iterate based on usage and feedback
