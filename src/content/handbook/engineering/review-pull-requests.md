Code review is essential for code quality, knowledge sharing, and catching issues early.

## Review checklist
- Does the code solve the right problem?
- Is it well-tested and documented?
- Does it follow our coding conventions?
- Are there any security or performance concerns?
- Could it be simpler or more maintainable?

## Review process
- All PRs need at least one approval
- Complex changes need domain expert review
- Security-sensitive changes need security team review
- Breaking changes need architecture team approval

## How We Approach CI/CD

### Continuous Integration
- All tests run on every commit
- Builds are fast and reliable
- Automated security scanning
- Code quality checks (linting, formatting)

### Continuous Deployment
- Automated deployment to staging
- Manual approval for production
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Automated rollback on critical failures

### Monitoring
- Comprehensive observability
- Real-time alerting
- Performance tracking
- User impact monitoring
