We use RFCs (Request for Comments) to design significant technical changes collaboratively.

## When to write an RFC
- New product features or major changes
- Architecture decisions that affect multiple systems
- Breaking changes to APIs or interfaces
- Complex technical problems requiring research

## RFC process
1. Write the RFC document with problem, solution, alternatives
2. Share for async feedback and iteration
3. Schedule RFC review meeting if needed
4. Get approval from relevant stakeholders
5. Use RFC as implementation guide
