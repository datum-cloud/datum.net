## Development process
1. **Design** - Create detailed specs and get feedback
2. **Build** - Implement with automated tests
3. **Review** - Code review and testing
4. **Deploy** - Gradual rollout with monitoring
5. **Measure** - Track usage and impact

## Quality gates
- All code must have tests
- Security review for sensitive changes
- Performance testing for infrastructure changes
- Documentation updated before shipping
