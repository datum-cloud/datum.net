## Core infrastructure
- **Go** - Primary backend language for performance and reliability
- **Rust** - For performance-critical networking components
- **TypeScript/React** - Frontend applications and dashboards
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database for structured data
- **Redis** - Caching and session management

## Infrastructure
- **Kubernetes** - Container orchestration
- **Terraform** - Infrastructure as code
- **BGP/BIRD** - Network routing protocols
- **DPDK** - High-performance packet processing
- **eBPF** - Network observability and security

## AI/ML
- **Python** - ML workflows and data processing
- **PyTorch** - Machine learning models
- **CUDA** - GPU acceleration where needed
