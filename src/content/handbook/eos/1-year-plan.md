Each year we focus on achieving 3-7 key goals aligned with our company vision, including specific measurable targets for each goal. At such an early stage, this is more art than science, but it’s a very useful exercise to build as a team.

Our current goals we set in December of 2025. As such, by December 2026 we aim to tackle the following.

## Measurables

- Revenue: $50k MRR, growing fast

- 250 total quality organizations on the platform

- 5000 builders on the platform

- 1000 active ecosystem connections

## Goals for the year
_(S.M.A.R.T.) Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound_

- Partnership with meaningful AI leader activated

- 3 magnetic alt cloud providers activated

- Established with builder community (thousands of daily touchpoints)

- Differentiated connectivity assets in place

- Milo in use by 1 contributing organization
