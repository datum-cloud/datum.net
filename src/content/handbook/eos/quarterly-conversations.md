This template helps structure meaningful quarterly conversations between managers and team members at Datum. Each person should complete the template before a conversation, focusing on honest reflection and forward-looking discussion. The purpose is to foster open communication, align on priorities, identify support needs, and enable growth.

## Tips for Success

- Be honest and specific in your responses
- Focus on the future as much as the past
- Come prepared with examples
- Remember this is a conversation, not an evaluation
- Be constructive when discussing challenges and include potential solutions
- Ground level/step discussions in evidence of impact and performance

## 1. Current State

What's going well right now?
What challenges are you facing? How can I help?

## 2. Last Quarter Reflection

What impact did you have last quarter? What felt successful?
What do you want to improve or work on differently?

## 3. Growth & Development

Datum's compensation framework uses levels to reflect impact, and steps to reflect performance within that level.

### Levels
- Junior: Contributes to small or function-specific projects
- Intermediate: Owns small to medium projects, including cross-functional work
- Senior: Accountable for large projects and drives everything necessary to complete them
- Lead: Consistently drives strategic projects that impact the company

### Steps
- Learning: Starting to match expectations
- Established: Matching expectations
- Thriving: Exceeding expectations
- Expert: Exceeding expectations consistently

### Reflecting on your current level and step

Based on the definitions above, how do you see yourself performing at your current level? What examples demonstrate this?

### How are you developing in your role? What skills are you building?

### What would progression look like for you?

Consider: Are you focused on deepening expertise at your current level (step progression) or expanding your impact scope (level progression)? What would that require?

What support or resources would help you grow?

## 4. Collaboration & Input

Where could your expertise be better utilized? What initiatives excite you?

How can we work together more effectively?

## 5. Values & Culture
