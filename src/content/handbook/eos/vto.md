The “Vision / Traction Organizer” captures the core DNA of our business: our values, purpose, and long-term vision. As a team we review this document once per year to ensure it still fits.


## Core Values

### Who we are

- We are connectors - of people, businesses, apps and networks. ABCD!
- We are operators at heart 
- We are passionate about working in the open

### How we act

- We find creative answers to hard problems
- We prioritize outcomes for users, customers, and partners
- We write our own words


## Core Focus (Hedgehog Concept)

- **Purpose/Cause/Passion** - Helping 1k new clouds thrive in the AI era
- **Niche** - We unlock internet superpowers for builders
- **Economic Engine** - We are the best way for “alt cloud” providers to interact


## 10-Year Target

The most trusted way for AI & digital ecosystems to interact (w/ millions of active connections to prove it).


## The Speech

The internet's most powerful capabilities (global connectivity, peering, deterministic routing, curated peers) have been locked away from the builders who need them most. Hidden behind public clouds and telco-era interfaces with impossible barriers to entry, these superpowers sit out of reach while the world fractures into thousands of specialized clouds, each one critical to the AI-driven future we're building.

We don’t think this fragmentation is a bug, but a core feature of the tomorrow we want to see. The world is expanding beyond public clouds, and what's emerging is better: a Cambrian explosion of purpose-built infrastructure - AI clouds, data and security clouds, edge networks, sovereign platforms - each optimized for what it does best. But they can't thrive in isolation.

That’s why we exist. **To help 1,000 new clouds thrive in the AI era by unlocking internet superpowers for every builder.** Not by abstracting away the power, but by putting it directly in builders' hands. That’s why we look for people to join us who are community-minded, helping to connect people, agents, businesses, apps, and networks. 

Ultimately, we are operators at heart - internet “plumbers” who find creative answers to hard problems. We work in the open because that's how trust is built and how the best ideas win. We prioritize outcomes for the people who matter: our users, customers, and partners. And in today’s noisy world, we write our own words because authenticity isn't optional.

In ten years, we expect to be **the most trusted way for AI and digital ecosystems to interact**, with millions of active connections to prove it. But the real measure of success won't be in the metrics. It'll be in the builders who shipped something impossible, the partnerships that unlocked new value, and the future we helped connect into existence.

At Datum, we’re reimagining the internet for a world reshaped by AI. Join us?
