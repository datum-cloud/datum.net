## Voice characteristics
- **Technical but accessible** - We know our stuff but explain it clearly
- **Confident but humble** - We're building something important but stay grounded
- **Direct but friendly** - We don't waste words but we're human
- **Inclusive but expert** - We welcome newcomers but maintain technical depth

## Tone guidelines
- Use active voice and clear, simple sentences
- Avoid jargon unless necessary (and define it when used)
- Be specific with examples rather than abstract concepts
- Show don't tell - demonstrate value with real examples
- Maintain optimism about the future we're building

## Writing principles
- **Clarity over cleverness** - Make it easy to understand
- **Useful over promotional** - Lead with value, not just features
- **Authentic over polished** - Be genuine about challenges and progress
- **Specific over general** - Use concrete examples and metrics
