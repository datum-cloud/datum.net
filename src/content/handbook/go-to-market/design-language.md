We maintain a **foundational, hyperscale-ready framework** that guides the design of all user experiences within the Datum ecosystem. This design language ensures consistency while allowing for the flexibility needed across different products and contexts.

**Design philosophy:**
- **Hyperscale-ready** - Built to work at massive scale and complexity
- **Developer-first** - Interfaces designed for people who think in code
- **Systematically consistent** - Coherent experience across all touchpoints
- **Future-oriented** - Designed for the AI-native world we're building

**Key design elements:**
- **Typography** - Clean, technical fonts that maintain readability at all scales
- **Color system** - Professional palette that works across digital and physical applications
- **Iconography** - Systematic icon library that speaks to our technical audience
- **Imagery** - Photography and illustrations that show real technology in action

**Brand applications:**
- Product interfaces and dashboards
- Marketing websites and materials
- Documentation and technical content
- Conference presentations and swag
- Social media and digital advertising
