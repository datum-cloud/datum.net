Our brand personality and visual identity are guided by five core principles that reflect who we are and how we show up in the world:

## Grounded and Visionary
We think big, but back it up with elegant, thoughtful products that solve authentic, real-world problems. Our designs balance ambitious thinking with practical execution.

## Approachable and Expert
Our deep sector expertise is accompanied by an inclusive, collaborative, optimistic, curious ethos. We make complex technology accessible without dumbing it down.

## Proactive and Driven
We constantly and transparently evolve in our quest to empower and support companies to build, invent, and compete, at scale. Our brand reflects forward momentum and continuous improvement.

## Conscientious and Ethical
We always aim to do the right thing, whether helping businesses lower their carbon emissions, or treating all people with respect, dignity, and empathy. This shows through in how we communicate and what we prioritize.

## Self Aware
We are humble enough to recognize when we're not perfect, sound overly grandiose, or overdo the jargon, and aren't afraid of poking fun at ourselves accordingly. Our brand has personality and doesn't take itself too seriously.
