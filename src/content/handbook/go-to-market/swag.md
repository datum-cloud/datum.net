Swag should be useful, high-quality, and reflect our engineering culture.

## Good swag principles
- Actually useful - Things people will genuinely use
- High quality - Reflects our commitment to excellence
- Tasteful design - Professional but not boring
- Limited quantities - Makes it feel special, not cheap

## Swag ideas
- High-quality t-shirts and hoodies
- Network topology posters or stickers
- Developer tools (good cables, adapters)
- Conference giveaways that start conversations
