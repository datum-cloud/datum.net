## Company

### Why We Exist

We're convinced that basically every important business going forward will be digital, and will require "hyperscaler" or "modern service provider" advantages to truly compete and win. However, most companies simply don't have the capabilities, the resources, the relationships, or the time to do it all. We believe we can help 1-2k of them play to win. This is our "why".

Over the last cycle, developers were abstracted from the lowest, most critical layers of networking. Powerful capabilities like private connectivity, peering, and deterministic routing are now basically invisible to them, with a high barrier to entry and an interface stuck in the telco era. At the same time, our software-driven world is getting more complex and fragmented right alongside a rapid increase in the value of connected, data-aware global experiences.

We think developers need networking superpowers to build the best version of the future and connect securely with the partners, providers, applications, and customers that help them win. Our mission is to make it happen.

### What We Believe

**Open is better** - We believe in the power of open source to build trust, enable innovation, and serve the "non bell curve" crowd. Our products are backed by AGPLv3 licenses so users can invest confidently and adapt as needed.

**Software is the customer** - We design for developers who think in code, not infrastructure engineers stuck in the telco era. Everything should be programmable, accessible, and AI-native.

**Partners have real value** - We're not trying to replace everything. We're building a neutral ecosystem where the best providers can thrive and connect with their customers.

**Differentiation matters** - While public clouds focus on 80% "bell curve" use cases, we serve the providers who need to drive differentiation in price, performance, features, timing, and reach.

### Our Values

**We are connectors** â€” of people, businesses, apps and networks. At our core, we believe in creating bridges where others build walls.

**We are operators at heart** who know how to get stuff done. We don't just theorize; we build, ship, and scale.

**We value grit, humility and hunger** - We welcome bold ideas and reject inertia, but also embrace empathy and continuous learning.

**We invest in relationships** - We operate with honesty and look for savvy yet humble people who can't help but act like owners.

### Who We Are Building For

Our customers are **AI-native providers and digital leaders**: AI startups, alt clouds, and next-gen enterprises who are building what's next. They're focused on innovation, speed to market, and making the future possible.

These are companies like Vercel, Snowflake, Roblox, Palo Alto Networks, Hugging Face, Datadog, American Express, Databricks, and Walmart - providers who want to drive differentiation or meet increasingly complex regulatory requirements.

They need to:
- Acquire "hyperscaler" infrastructure advantages
- Efficiently operate connected cloud experiences at scale, globally and across diverse environments
- Securely connect a fragmented ecosystem: 10's of cloud regions, 100's of partners, 1000's of customers
- Have end-to-end observability across clouds and providers, using their standard tooling
- React to increasingly complex regulatory, security, privacy, performance, and business requirements
- Evolve alongside AI and interact with infrastructure using reasoning and AI-native concepts

### Our Open Source Strategy

We're building Datum Cloud as open source with AGPLv3 licensing because we believe transparency and community are essential for infrastructure that people depend on. 

**Why open source matters for us:**
- **Trust** - Our customers can see exactly what they're running and how it works
- **No lock-in** - You can run Datum Cloud anywhere - our cloud, your cloud, or on-premises
- **Community innovation** - The best solutions come from diverse contributors solving real problems
- **Neutrality** - Open source reinforces our position as a neutral operator, not a competitor

**Our open source commitment:**
- Core Datum Cloud functionality is fully open source
- Community contributions are welcomed and celebrated
- Documentation and examples are extensive and maintained
- We provide clear paths for both self-hosted and managed deployments

By 2027, we aim to have 150+ open source contributors actively improving the platform.

### Our Neutral Strategy

Unlike hyperscale clouds that want to lock you into their ecosystem, we're building Datum to be genuinely neutral. We succeed when our ecosystem partners succeed.

**What neutral means:**
- **No margin stacking** - We use transparent, rebill-style commercial models
- **Partner-first mindset** - We're designed to amplify your differentiation, not compete with it
- **Open ecosystem** - We connect providers with their unique ecosystem advantage
- **Technology agnostic** - We support diverse technology partners and their channels

**Why neutrality is our strategy:**
- The market needs a "Switzerland" for digital infrastructure
- Providers need a place to collaborate without competitive dynamics
- Innovation happens when different technologies can work together seamlessly
- Trust is earned by consistently acting in everyone's best interest

### Our AI Strategy

We're not just building for the current internet - we're building the internet that AI needs.

**AI is changing everything:**
- **Complexity explosion** - AI workloads are more distributed, data-intensive, and performance-sensitive
- **New interfaces** - AI agents need programmatic, reasoning-friendly interfaces to infrastructure
- **Ecosystem importance** - AI leaders win by orchestrating powerful ecosystems, not building everything themselves
- **Global requirements** - AI services need to run everywhere with deterministic performance

**How we're building for AI:**
- **AI-native interfaces** - Our platform speaks the language of modern AI systems and agents
- **Intelligent routing** - AI-driven traffic optimization and policy enforcement
- **Ecosystem orchestration** - Seamless connection between AI providers, cloud platforms, and enterprise customers
- **Performance guarantees** - Deterministic routing and observability for mission-critical AI workloads

Our 10-year target: The most trusted way for AI and digital ecosystems to interact (with millions of active connections to prove it).

### How We Got Here

Datum was born from the experience of building and scaling infrastructure companies like Packet (acquired by Equinix). We saw firsthand how the best teams get stuck stitching together complex infrastructure instead of focusing on their core differentiation.

The founding insight: What if we could give every innovative company the networking superpowers that only hyperscalers have today?

**Key moments in our journey:**
- Recognized the growing abstraction gap between developers and networking
- Understood that AI would accelerate this complexity exponentially  
- Saw the opportunity to update the collaborative, open architecture of the original internet
- Decided to build neutral infrastructure that serves providers, not competes with them
- Committed to open source as the foundation for trust and community

### What Inspires Us

**The original internet** - We're inspired by the collaborative, open architecture that built the foundation of our digital world. We want to update that vision for the AI era.

**The next 1,000 hyperscalers** - Every important business needs infrastructure superpowers to compete. We want to democratize access to those capabilities.

**Developer empowerment** - The best solutions come from empowering smart people to solve their own problems, not prescribing one-size-fits-all solutions.

**Ecosystem thinking** - The companies that win long-term sit at the center of powerful, value-creating ecosystems.

### How We Make Money

We make money when our ecosystem thrives. Our business model aligns our success with our customers' success.

**Revenue streams:**
- **Datum Cloud** - Managed infrastructure services with transparent, usage-based pricing
