Datum uses Ashby as its applicant tracking system to coordinate recruiting activities. All job postings, candidate communications, interview scheduling, and hiring decisions are routed through Ashby to ensure a consistent and professional experience for candidates.

If you apply for a position, our goal is to be prompt and responsive about our process and next steps. If we don’t think you’re a fit for a particular role, we’ll do our very best to let you know quickly.

**Important**: one thing that will really help your application and our process is if you engage with our cloud product, our open source repositories, and community (Discord, etc) before applying. This will allow you to have a much better sense of what we’re building and where you could add the most value.


## Interview process

Candidates will first pass through an internal screening process to determine broad fit for a role, including any location or skills requirements. At that point, 1:1 interviews with the hiring manager take place and are the focus of the recruitment process. 

As a small company, everyone works cross-functionally. As such, we bring a small group (3-5) of candidates to a broader interview process that includes colleagues from across the business. The goal is to validate fit in terms of values, skills, culture, and communication while providing a deeper opportunity for the applicant to learn about Datum.

The hiring manager will then coordinate any final interviews, which includes meeting with our co-founder and CEO, Zac. Huzzah!


## Offer letters, trial days, and validation of humanity

If we’re all excited to proceed, the hiring manager will prepare an offer letter for consideration. This should be inline with our public compensation approach, but will include all the necessary details including an equity offer.

Next, we’ll arrange for a paid working day if feasible. This will mainly involve joining any team meetings and working in our open source repositories.

Finally, all new hires are required to meet with a member of the Datum team in person before their official start date. This in-person meeting serves multiple purposes:

- **Identity Verification**: In this bold new AI era, we need to verify that you’re a real, live human, and that everything matches your provided identity. 

- **I-9 Compliance**: For US-based employees, we complete required Form I-9 employment eligibility verification, which mandates physical inspection of identity and work authorization documents

- **Team Connection**: This meeting provides an opportunity to welcome new team members, answer questions, and begin building relationships

If we don’t have a team or board member nearby your location, we will coordinate travel to a mutually convenient location and cover the costs.
