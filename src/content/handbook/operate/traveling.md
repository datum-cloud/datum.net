All US-based employees use Ramp for expense management, which includes travel related purchases. The guidelines below are suggestions to help frame good judgment.

**Business travel principles** - Everyone in the company should try to book travel that balances cost, quality and convenience. Use your Ramp card and make sure to get approval for:
* Travel over $2,000 (total trip cost)
* All international travel
* Any single expense over $1,000

**Flights** - When taking to the skies, please keep the following in mind:
* Economy class for all flights (premium economy for flights over 6 hours).
* Fly direct when the price is reasonable. Max ~$600 roundtrip.
* Use Ramp Travel or book through any site with your Ramp card
* Book as far in advance as possible to get the best price
* Typical domestic flights should be under $600 roundtrip
* One checked bag covered for trips over 3 nights (keep receipts for fees)

**Hotels** - When booking hotels, here’s what we recommend:
* Choose hotels convenient to your meetings
* Standard business hotels (Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, Holiday Inn) or Airbnb
* Take advantage of our corporate discount rate with Holiday Inn properties in NYC
* Conference hotel blocks may exceed limits, so consider a nearby option when possible
* Feel free to earn personal loyalty points
* Aim for $225/night or less in major cities, $175/night in midsize cities.

**Ground transportation** - We cover the following transportation, ideally using your Ramp card:
* Uber/Lyft for business travel
* Taxis and public transportation
* Airport parking up to $40/day (for trips under 5 days)
* Tolls and parking at business locations

Rental cars require manager approval. If you do need to rent a car (via a major agency or also Turo) make sure to choose economy or mid-size vehicles where possible.

* **IMPORTANT:** Accept the rental car insurance (CDW/LDW).
* Our company insurance covers liability but NOT damage to the rental car itself
* Keep all receipts including rental insurance charges

For use of your personal car, we reimburse at IRS rate ($0.67/mile in 2025). Please submit mileage log via Ramp with start/end points and business purpose. Note: we do not reimburse for regular commuting, such as to an office or coworking space.

**Eating while traveling for work**
* $75/day (domestic) or $100/day (international)
* These are maximums, not entitlements, so please use good judgment
* Upload receipts for meals over $25, including names of fellow diners
* Alcohol is fine when dining with clients, prospects, or team. Please drink responsibly.

**Other travel**
* We coordinate and book accommodations on your behalf for team events.
* Pre-approval is required for conferences

**Out-of-pocket reimbursements**
* Use Ramp cards whenever possible. For rare exceptions, submit via Ramp app with receipt and business purpose within 10 days.
