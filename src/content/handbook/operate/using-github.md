GitHub is a critical piece of infrastructure and a daily working environment for everyone on our team. We use it in the following ways:

- As a code repository for all public projects (Datum, Milo, and related) as well as private projects (stuff that we use to run Datum Cloud)

- To organize our work, from releases down to enhancements and issues

- To drive content on our website, including docs, handbook, changelog, roadmap, etc.

- To organize our work within and across teams

- To solicit new ideas and debate the options, via GitHub Discussions

As a central tool for our team, every team member at Datum is expected to embrace a solid dose of markdown. Of course, GitHub can also be pretty confusing, so we’re happy to help you get up to speed as part of onboarding.

Here are a few useful tips:

1. If you want to suggest a new feature - Start a discussion or review [enhancements](https://github.com/orgs/datum-cloud/projects/22/views/1)

2. If you want to know what’s being worked on - Check out the latest Milestone

3. If you want to review recent activity - See the [#github-updates](https://datum-inc.slack.com/archives/C07UMLMJHGC).

We ask our Engineering team to curate the Enhancements and Release aspects of GitHub, but active commenting is always appreciated.
