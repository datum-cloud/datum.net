Feedback is a gift - both giving and receiving it well is essential for our growth.

## Giving feedback
- Be direct but kind
- Focus on specific behaviors and outcomes
- Offer suggestions for improvement
- Give feedback promptly when relevant
- Use "I" statements to avoid blame

## Receiving feedback
- Listen without getting defensive
- Ask clarifying questions
- Thank the person for their input
- Follow up on actions you commit to

## Formal feedback
- Regular 1:1s with your manager
- Quarterly goal reviews
- Annual 360-degree feedback process
- Project-specific feedback sessions
