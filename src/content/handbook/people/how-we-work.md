We're a remote-first company that believes in async-first communication and autonomy. Every team member is empowered to make decisions in their domain and drive projects forward.

## Core principles
- **Remote-first** - We're designed for distributed work across time zones
- **Async-first** - We default to written communication and recorded decisions
- **Autonomy with alignment** - Clear goals and context, with freedom to execute
- **Transparency by default** - Information is open unless there's a specific reason to keep it private
