We trust team members to spend money responsibly on behalf of the company. 

## General principles
- Act like an owner - spend company money like it's your own
- When in doubt, ask - but don't let perfect be the enemy of good
- Document expenses clearly for transparency
- Choose quality tools that help us work better

## Spending guidelines
- Under $500: Just do it (within reason)
- $500-2000: Get manager approval
- Over $2000: Needs finance team review
- Recurring subscriptions: Always get approval first
