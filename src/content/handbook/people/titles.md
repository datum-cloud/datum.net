Titles should reflect what you actually do, not just seniority. We prefer descriptive titles that help people understand your focus and expertise.

## Title philosophy
- Clarity over hierarchy
- Function over seniority
- Authenticity over inflation
- Evolution as roles grow

## Examples
- "AI Infrastructure Engineer" not "Senior Engineer"
- "Developer Experience Lead" not "Manager"
- "Ecosystem Partnerships" not "Business Development"
