This policy articulates the standards of behavior expected of everyone at Datum, as well as in our community forums (e.g. Discord, meetups, etc). As such, it applies to all work-related settings and activities, including at our offices, events, travel, client sites, and online communications related to Datum.

Our Code reflects our commitment to integrity, professionalism, and creating a positive workplace culture. All employees are expected to treat colleagues, clients, vendors, and visitors with courtesy and respect. Here are some examples:

- Communicate professionally and constructively
- Maintain a positive attitude and contribute to a collaborative work environment
- Arrive on time and meet commitments and deadlines
- Use Company time, resources, and property responsibly
- Follow safety protocols and report unsafe conditions immediately
- Refrain from working under the influence of drugs or alcohol
- Maintain a workplace free from violence or threats of violence

## Ethical business practices

1. **Conflicts of Interest** - Employees must avoid situations where personal interests conflict or appear to conflict with the Company's interests. This includes outside employment competing with Datum, financial interests in competitors or suppliers, hiring family members without disclosure, and accepting inappropriate gifts from business partners. All potential conflicts must be disclosed to management promptly.

2. **Confidentiality** - Employees must protect confidential Company information, trade secrets, proprietary data, and client information. Use confidential information only for legitimate business purposes, and continue to maintain confidentiality after employment ends. Follow all information security policies.

3. **Accurate Records** - Maintain accurate, complete, and honest business records. Report time, expenses, and financial information truthfully. Never falsify documents or misrepresent facts. Cooperate fully with audits and report suspected fraud immediately.

4. **Legal Compliance** - Comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. Follow industry-specific regulations and all Company policies. Seek guidance when unsure about requirements.

## Use of company resources
Company property and technology systems (computers, email systems, SaaS tools, etc) are primarily for business use. Personal use should be minimal and not interfere with work responsibilities. Employees should have no expectation of privacy when using Company systems. Prohibited uses include accessing inappropriate content, sending offensive materials, or engaging in illegal activities. 

## AI platforms & confidential information
It’s very important that employees never upload, share, or input confidential Company information, proprietary data, customer information, or trade secrets into AI platforms, large language models, or similar third-party tools unless explicitly authorized.

## Social media
When using social media (LinkedIn, blogging, Instagram, etc), do not disclose confidential Company information. If you are interacting on a personal basis, make clear that your personal views do not represent the Company. Be respectful and professional when discussing work-related topics.

## Client, partner and vendor relationships
Earning the trust of our clients and partners is key to our business strategy. In addition to providing high-quality, timely communication, please be honest about Datum’s capabilities and limitations. Deal fairly and honestly with users, customers, partners, vendors, and competitors. 

## Gifts and entertainment
Modest business courtesies are acceptable if they do not create obligation or appearance of impropriety. Gifts or entertainment that could influence business decisions must be declined. Cash or cash equivalents should never be accepted. When in doubt, consult with management.

## Diversity and inclusion
Datum is committed to creating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. We value diverse perspectives, provide equal opportunities for all qualified individuals, and foster an environment free from discrimination and harassment. See our Anti-Harassment and Discrimination Policy for details.

## Reporting violations
Employees who observe or become aware of conduct that violates either the letter or spirit of our policies or applicable laws must report it promptly to their supervisor, our Human Resources function ssmyser@datum.net, or senior management.

All reports will be taken seriously, investigated promptly, and handled with discretion to the extent possible. Appropriate corrective action will be taken when violations are confirmed.

Datum strictly prohibits retaliation against anyone who reports a suspected violation in good faith, participates in an investigation, or refuses to engage in conduct that violates this Code. Retaliation is itself a serious violation and will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.

## Consequences
Violations of this Code may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. The severity of action will depend on the nature and severity of the violation, whether it was intentional, the employee's prior record, and other relevant factors.

## Questions
If you have questions about this Code or how it applies to a specific situation, contact our Human Resources function at ssmyser@datum.net, speak with your supervisor, or reach out to any of our senior management team. When in doubt, please ask! It's always better to seek guidance than to risk violating the Code.
