Building trust with customers is essential to our business strategy. One of the most important ways to do that as an operator is with a culture that underpins a rigorous operational and security stance.

In developing these policies, we’ve drawn heavily from Tailscale’s [excellent assets](https://github.com/tailscale/security-policies?tab=readme-ov-file), which are released under a creative commons license. More importantly, they are shared with a “better together” spirit that resonates with everyone at Datum. 

The following policies are reviewed annually by our Head of Finance and Operations. If you have any questions or concerns, please reach out to security@datum.net.
