Datum is a growing company that reviews risks on a regular basis and updates its hiring and personnel policies accordingly. 

## Reference checks
As part of its hiring process, Datum does not perform full criminal background checks, but does employ a reference check process for prospective employment candidates prior to or within 30 days of their hire date.

## Physical meeting requirement
To mitigate the risks of impersonation in our remote-first company, all prospective contractors and employees must meet in person with a Datum representative before being granted access to internal systems.

## Security awareness training
All employees must complete Datum’s information security awareness training as part of their initial onboarding and thereafter, while still under contract, on an annual basis.

## Performance reviews
All full time employees must complete an annual Performance Review, the results of which are signed and dated by both the employee and their manager, and uploaded to the employee’s personnel files in the HR system.
