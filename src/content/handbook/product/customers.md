* Geographic - English speaking “service provider” businesses targeting global audiences. 
* Psychographic - Focused on performance, security, and scalability.

## Three Uniques
Currently aspirational, here are three unique ingredients we’re working to assemble:
* We have the largest ecosystem of magnetic “alt cloud” service providers
* We have a holistic commitment to open source that engenders confidence & trust
* We have a strong set of “house brand” solutions alongside partner technologies

## Proven Process:
In other words, how do we go about getting more customers:

* Launch new initiatives (including open source) with a cloud-first experience
* Work closely with clients and a community to build elegant product experiences
