Datum is working to bring the internet superpowers all the big guys use directly into tools like Cursor and Kubernetes. 
We want to ensure that applications communicate securely and efficiently — connecting systems, networks, and data for the AI economy across a few focused areas: 
* Runtime – Network, data, and security workloads at the edge.
* Connections – Private, secure connectivity between apps and networks.
* Workflows - Automation templates to improve reliability and customize behavior
* Assets - Programmatic resources to support your deployments
* Provider Automation – Tools that help modern cloud providers grow

Even though we’re excited and proud of our product vision, what we’re doing isn’t revolutionary under the hood. Most big companies have built amazing global networks over the years. The large clouds and CDN’s have pushed the envelope to create scalable services on top of their networks, abstracting users from the complexity and mess of global connectivity.
What we’re trying to do is shrink the process to build a global network (usually a few years if you know what you’re doing), put it into a new package (cloud and AI-native tooling), and help every builder innovate with it. 
If we’re successful, we expect that this new generation of builders will move from abstraction to sophistication, shaping new ways to secure and connect in the AI era.
