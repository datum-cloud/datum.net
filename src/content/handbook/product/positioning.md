**AI is evolving fast. So should the internet.**
Datum is the neutral, open network cloud designed to power the next 1k clouds.

We connect fragmented ecosystems across clouds, providers, and enterprises—giving builders the programmatic control, performance, and observability they need to operate in an AI-native world. With an open source foundation and a business model built on the success of partners, we connect providers with their unique ecosystem advantage, so they can play to win. 

In addition to enabling substantial cost, performance and security benefits, Datum’s open network cloud is focused on helping modern “alt cloud” providers accelerate enterprise deals, remove customer friction, and turn internet foundations into innovation. 

Use cases we’re excited about include:  
- Embedding connectivity into diverse environments, from cloud to local-first
- Enabling private, secure interconnection between customers, clouds, and partners
- Securing machine-to-machine (and agent-to-agent) experiences for agentic flows
- Meeting complex privacy and regulatory rules with deterministic, policy-based routing
- Integrating Internet scale networking into developer workflows (e.g. CI/CD, E2E testing)
- Helping accelerate customers with automated domain validation and SSL for SaaS apps
