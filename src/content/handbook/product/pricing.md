We currently have outlined three tiers of service. Only time in the market will tell us if we’re correct, and where we need to evolve. Since this entry is likely to get out of date from time to time, please check our [pricing page](https://www.datum.net/pricing/) for the latest official details. 

**Datum for Builders** (Forever free)
Our initial focus is to help a new class of builders get access to the core ‘internet superpowers’ for learning, integration, testing, and exploring new use cases. We also want to make their lives easier when it comes to troublesome bits like domains, certificates, and DNS. 
* $0/mo
* Generous quotas
* No paid option

**Datum for SaaS** (Production grade self-service)
We hope that many builders and platform engineers will want to consume our value in production use cases. To do that, they’ll want an SLA and we’ll need to charge money, especially for sending traffic across our backbone and brokering connections with clouds, etc. 
* $20/mo + usage
* Expanded features
* 24/7 email support 

**Datum for Providers** (High touch, curated offering)
This is where our heart and focus lies. Our business strategy is centered around helping modern SaaS and cloud providers thrive, from accelerating revenue and mitigating security risks to improve performance and lowering costs. This is our jam.  
* $2,500/mo + usage
* Curated features, dedicated infrastructure
* White glove, proactive support
