Working in the open is a core construct at Datum, but the area of transparency that we put the most effort into is communicating our roadmap as well as our backlog for consideration.
Just like this company handbook, our roadmap and changelog are managed through GitHub and displayed on our website. 
While it’s somewhat of a new practice, we try to ideate around potential features in [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/orgs/datum-cloud/discussions). If you’re a new user or community member, this is a great place to share your feedback and suggest approaches alongside real-time chat on our [Discord server](https://link.datum.net/discord).
Once ideas are formalized we create [detailed enhancements](https://github.com/orgs/datum-cloud/projects/22) that prepare the work. Since this is where all active work on our various open source projects are tracked and progressed, this is how we generate our public roadmap for [datum.net](http://datum.net) and milo-os.com. 
As the work on enhancements are completed, we publish notices to [GitHub Discussions](http://datum.net) and include a summary in our monthly newsletter.
