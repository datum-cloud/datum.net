Datum is an operator-led culture. This means we put a lot of emphasis on our role, and experience, as operators. 

To use the famous [StoryBrand](https://storybrand.com/downloads/your-brand-is-not-the-hero.pdf) method, we firmly believe that we are not the most interesting part of the story. Instead, we expect our customers (and what they do with our platform) to be the real heroes of the story. We’re a supporting player.

We’re not Frodo, we’re Gandalf (or maybe Samwise Gamgee). We’re not Luke, we’re Yoda (or Obi-wan!). Our job is to help Frodo get to Mordor and Luke to crush the empire. Important, but supporting.

This mindset informs a lot about what we do, and helps us know what we shouldn’t do. Ultimately, our north star is to be a foundational infrastructure partner to our customers, who we believe are building their value directly on top of that infrastructure. No pressure, right? 

Ultimately, it comes down to things like trust, reliability, authenticity, transparency, responsiveness, and honesty. So as we build software, systems, and processes we work to balance the desire to finely craft every element to bullet-proof perfection, with a need to innovate at the speed of the market and our users.
