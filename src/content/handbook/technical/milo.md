[Milo is an open source](https://www.milo-os.com/) ‘system of action’ for product-led, B2B companies. Think of it as a business control plane designed specifically for cloud service providers, helping them innovate faster and scale better with less toil.

Much of Datum’s “cloudy” functionality is built into Milo, from authentication and user management to quotas and audit logging.  

The inspiration for investing in Milo as a standalone product comes from our team’s decades of experience scaling clouds (Voxel, Packet, SoftLayer, StackPath, etc), during which we spent a lot of time building software to run the business: contacts, users, accounts, usage, quotas, quotes, contracts, agreements, billing, etc.

Alas, nobody paid us to send them an accurate bill or dig up the expiration date on a service order. It was critical, but largely undifferentiated, work.

Since that time, a number of awesome tools have emerged to solve particular pain points (e.g. authorization, metering, or SOC2 audits), but you still have to stitch everything together and fill in the many gaps.

We’re building Datum to help 1k new clouds thrive in the era of AI, so it feels important to codify our experience in an open-source solution that can give other providers a leg up.
