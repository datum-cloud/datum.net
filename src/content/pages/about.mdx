# About Me

I'm a web developer passionate about modern web technologies. This website serves as both my portfolio and a demonstration of what can be achieved with Astro, MDX, and TailwindCSS.

## My Skills

- Frontend Development
- UI/UX Design
- Backend Development
- Content Creation

## Why Astro?

Astro is a modern static site generator that allows developers to use their favorite UI components while shipping less JavaScript. It's perfect for content-focused websites like blogs, documentation sites, and portfolios.

## The Tech Stack

This website is built using:

- **[Astro](https://astro.build/)**: The web framework that powers this site
- **[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)**: Markdown with JSX for content creation
- **[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: For type safety and better developer experience
