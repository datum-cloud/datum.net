A concise encapsulation of the core personality traits of our brand and user experiences.

<Container tag="section" class="grid gap-7.5 md:grid-cols-2 max-w-none lg:mt-16 md:mt-12 mt-8">

<BrandCardText title="Grounded and Visionary">
  We think big, but back it up with elegant, thoughtful products that solve authentic, real-world problems.
</BrandCardText>

<BrandCardText title="Approachable and Expert">
  Our deep sector expertise is accompanied by an inclusive, collaborative, optimistic, curious ethos.
</BrandCardText>

<BrandCardText title="Proactive and Driven">
  We constantly and transparently evolve in our quest to empower and support companies to build, invent, and compete, at scale.
</BrandCardText>

<BrandCardText title="Conscientious and Ethical">
  We always aim to do the right thing, whether helping businesses lower their carbon emissions, or treating all people with respect, dignity, and empathy.
</BrandCardText>

<BrandCardText title="Self Aware">
  We are humble enough to recognise when we’re not perfect, sound overly grandiose, or overdo the jargon, and aren’t afraid of poking fun at ourselves accordingly.
</BrandCardText>
