# Backbone as Code

Define, deploy, and manage your entire network backbone using simple, declarative code. No more manual configuration or complex network diagrams.

## Why Backbone as Code?

- **Version Controlled**: Track changes to your network infrastructure over time
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Define network topologies with simple YAML or JSON
- **Automated Deployments**: CI/CD pipeline integration for network changes
- **Instant Rollbacks**: Easily revert to previous network configurations
- **Network Testing**: Test changes in isolated environments before production deployment

## Example Backbone Definition

```yaml
backbone:
  regions:
    - name: us-east
      subnets: 
        - cidr: 10.0.0.0/16
          availability_zones: 3
      connections:
        - to: us-west
          bandwidth: 10Gbps
        - to: eu-central
          bandwidth: 5Gbps
          encrypted: true
```

## Implementation Process

1. Define your backbone network in code
2. Run automated validation and testing
3. Deploy changes with zero downtime
4. Monitor and optimize with real-time analytics
