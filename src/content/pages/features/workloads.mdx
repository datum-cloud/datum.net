# Snoozy Workloads

Put your workloads to sleep when they're not needed and wake them up only when necessary. Optimize resource utilization and dramatically reduce costs without sacrificing performance.

## Features

- **Intelligent Hibernation**: Automatically detect idle workloads and put them to sleep
- **Smart Wake-up**: Predictive algorithms that wake workloads before they're needed
- **Zero Cold Start**: Eliminate cold starts with our prewarming technology
- **Cost Optimization**: Pay only for what you use, when you use it
- **Resource Scheduling**: Define complex schedules based on historical usage patterns

## How It Works

Snoozy Workloads continuously monitors your application's resource utilization patterns and learns when specific workloads are likely to be needed. When workloads aren't actively being used, they're automatically scaled down or hibernated to save resources.

Workload Activity:
[████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 8:00 AM
[██████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 12:00 PM
[████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 8:00 PM

Resource Allocation:
[████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 8:00 AM
[██████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 12:00 PM
[████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 8:00 PM
```

## Typical Savings

Customers typically see 40-60% reduction in compute costs when implementing Snoozy Workloads, with zero impact on application performance or availability during peak usage times.
