# Hello, World!

Welcome to my new website built with **Astro**, **MDX**, and **TailwindCSS**!

## What makes this site special?

- **Fast Performance**: Astro's partial hydration means we only ship JavaScript when necessary
- **MDX Support**: Write content in Markdown with JSX components
- **Modern Styling**: TailwindCSS makes styling a breeze
- **SEO Friendly**: Static site generation provides excellent SEO capabilities

Here's a sample of what you can do with MDX:

```js
// You can include code snippets
const greeting = "Hello, world!";
console.log(greeting);
```

And you can include interactive components within your markdown!

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#fff',
      padding: '0.2rem 0.4rem',
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

<Highlight color="#25c2a0">Styled content using JSX components in MDX!</Highlight>
