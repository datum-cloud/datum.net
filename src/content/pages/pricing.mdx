## Datum is currently in a closed beta.

Our pricing is designed to create millions of connections between modern providers, their partners, and their customers.
In other words, we’re focused on making connections, not pushing bits. Here’s what you can expect:

- A generous hobby tier for personal use and experimentation 
- A robust self-service platform for production use cases
- A curated full-service experience for a more intimate experience

If you’re interested in our work and want to learn more or participate in our closed beta, we’d love to chat.
