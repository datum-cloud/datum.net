# Galactic VPC

Experience cloud networking at an unprecedented scale with Galactic VPC. Our virtual private cloud solution provides isolated network environments that span regions, clouds, and even planets (coming soon).

## Key Capabilities

- **Unlimited Scale**: No practical limits on network size or number of connected resources
- **Multi-Cloud Integration**: Seamlessly connect resources across AWS, GCP, Azure, and more
- **Unified Management**: Single control plane for all your network resources
- **Quantum-Resistant Security**: Advanced encryption that will resist quantum computing attacks
- **Telepathic Routing**: Routes packets based on intent, not just destination (okay, we made this one up)

## Architecture

Galactic VPC uses a distributed control plane with local enforcement agents to provide unprecedented scale while maintaining strict security boundaries. Our patent-pending "wormhole routing" creates high-speed connections between distant network segments.
