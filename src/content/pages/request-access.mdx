## Let's get to know each other, shall we?

### Contributors

We’re building in the open for a lot of reasons, but one of the best is that we can involve diverse perspectives from the beginning. If you'd like learn more or contribute in some way, please reach out or join us on GitHub and Discord.

### Partners

We’re looking for tech partners (especially in the networking and security space) who can engage in new ways of delivering their software value. No sales inquiries at this time, please.

### Early customers

If you’ve got real world use cases and want to be involved as we shape Datum, it would be fun to talk and see how we can help each other.
