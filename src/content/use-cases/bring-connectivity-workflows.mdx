# Bring Connectivity into Your Existing Workflows

Datum is designed to work the way you work, integrating seamlessly with your existing infrastructure and workflows without requiring you to change how you operate.

## Global Proxy Protection

Protect your applications with our global proxy solution that integrates with your existing security and networking policies. No need to rebuild your infrastructure - simply point your traffic through Datum's secure network.

## CNAME Integration

Create and manage CNAME records programmatically through our API, maintaining consistency with your existing DNS management workflows. Whether you're using Route 53, CloudFlare, or any other DNS provider, Datum works with your current setup.

## OpenTelemetry Observability

Get detailed end-to-end observability using OpenTelemetry (OTel) standards you're already familiar with. Datum's network provides rich telemetry data that integrates with your existing monitoring and observability stack.

## Kubernetes Resource Patterns

Leverage familiar Kubernetes resource patterns and YAML configurations. Datum extends your existing Kubernetes workflows rather than replacing them, making adoption seamless for your team.

## Key Benefits

- **Zero Disruption**: Works with your existing tools and processes
- **Familiar Patterns**: Uses Kubernetes resource patterns you already know
- **Rich Observability**: Integrates with OTel for comprehensive monitoring
