# Control Traffic Patterns, Without Building a Single Box

Shape, prioritize, and isolate traffic programmatically with Datum's software-defined networking approach. Get fine-grained control without the need for expensive hardware or middleboxes.

## Programmatic Traffic Shaping

Define traffic policies and routing rules through code and APIs. Adjust bandwidth allocation, implement quality of service (QoS) policies, and optimize traffic flows without touching physical hardware.

## Traffic Prioritization

Prioritize critical application traffic automatically based on your defined policies. Ensure your most important workloads get the bandwidth and latency they need, when they need it.

## Traffic Isolation

Isolate different types of traffic or tenant workloads using software-defined network segmentation. Create secure boundaries without physical network separation.

## Dynamic Policy Updates

Update traffic policies in real-time as your application requirements change. No need to reconfigure hardware or wait for network changes to take effect.

## Key Benefits

- **Software-Defined**: No hardware dependencies or middleboxes required
- **Programmatic Control**: Define policies through code and APIs
- **Real-Time Updates**: Change policies instantly as needs evolve
- **Cost Effective**: Eliminate expensive hardware requirements
